The player who picks the Move is either the one most aligned to the community or the one who played the largest role in earning their Fellowship. The Move you pick applies so long as you keep Fellowship with that community. Fellowship is lost if you betray them, or if you revoke their Fellowship for some reason, or if the Overlord destroys the community.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
