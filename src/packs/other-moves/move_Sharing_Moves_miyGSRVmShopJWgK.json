The player giving the Move always chooses which Move is shared. The player you are sharing with gains that Move, and can use it from now on. They write it onto their playbook, and it is now their Move too. You cannot share a Move you do not know, even if it is on your playbook. You cannot share a Move that says it cannot be shared. You cannot share a Move from a Destiny playbook or from a Powerful playbook.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
