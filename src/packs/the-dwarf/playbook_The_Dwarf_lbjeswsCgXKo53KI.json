The winds, howling against the mountains. Like the mountains, the Dwarves will never fall. We have endured. We will endure. But we know nothin' lasts forever. This threat you called us all here for, we feel it. We know it's comin'. Tha's why I came, why I was chosen to represent my people.</em></p>\n<p><em>Like a crop farmer takes winter, like an anvil takes blows, like a mountain takes an avalanche, so too shall I take this comin' darkness. The Dwarves will never fall, never yield, and never surrender.</em></p>\n<p><em>I am the Dwarf. I can take it. Just you try me.</em></p>\n</section>\n<section class=\"rules\">\n<div>\n<h2>Name</h2>\n<p><strong>Choose one or two from each, or make up your own:</strong></p>\n<p>Given Names: Austri, Aurvang, Bombur, Dain, Dvalin, Elda, Hannar, Lofar, Nar, Onar, Regina, Thoerin, Thror, Vestri, Vigg Clan Names: Alebringer, Blackrock, Boathater, Broadbeam, Darkminer, Drakeslayer, Firewheel, Grimtrigger, Petty-kin, Ploughswain, Skyforger, Stonefoot, Undermountain, Vulcan</p>\n<h3>Look</h3>\n<p>Choose one from each list, or make up your own:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Weary Eyes, Hard Eyes, or Beady Eyes</li>\n<li>Braided Beard, Flowing Locks, or Immaculate Sideburns</li>\n<li>Calloused Skin, Bronzed Skin, or Stony Skin</li>\n<li>Laborer's Leathers, Noble's Silks, or Soldier's Armor</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Agenda</h3>\n<p><strong>When you know not what to do, consult your Agendas.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>You have these three Agendas:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Be Brave, Take Risks</li>\n<li>Tell Us Of Your People</li>\n<li>Improve The World Around You</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>And choose a fourth Agenda that only you follow:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Insatiable Greed</strong></p>\n<p>Take for yourself that which was meant for others.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>The Dwarven Craft</strong></p>\n<p>Create, restore, and protect things of lasting value.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>The Honored Word</strong></p>\n<p>Keep your word in all things, and punish the liars and oath-breakers.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Stats</h3>\n<p>Your <strong>Iron</strong> stat is +2. Assign +2, +1, +1, +0, -1 to the others.</p>\n<h2>What is a Dwarf?</h2>\n<p><strong>Choose the option that best represents your people:</strong></p>\n<h4>Deepdelve</h4>\n<p>Your people dig deeper than any others, and the secrets of the earth are yours. You can see in total darkness without a problem, and your armor is born of the secrets that can only be found deep underground.</p>\n<p>Add The Secrets (3 Uses) to your Gear. You can Use them at any time to immediately ask one question from the Look Closely or Speak Softly lists.</p>\n<h4>firebeard</h4>\n<p>Your people lead a war-like life, with a long history of bloodshed and tragedy. Your armor has seen many battles, and it has seen you through all of them. When you attempt to defeat an enemy in glorious combat, you may damage your Blood to try to Finish Them with +Blood or +Sense.</p>\n<h4>ironblast</h4>\n<p>Your people are madcap inventors and chemists, known throughout the world for their wondrous, and dangerous, creations. Your armor is of unusual design, with many bits and pieces that serve no obvious purpose.</p>\n<p>Add Various Explosive Devices (2 Uses, Dangerous) to your Gear. You can Use your explosives to create an explosion wherever you need it, as long as you could have conceivably planted them ahead of time.</p>\n<h4>stoneborn</h4>\n<p>Your kin have more in common with the earth and stone than they do with flesh and blood. Your armor is your bare skin, solid as stone.</p>\n<p>When you stand on solid ground, you cannot be knocked off your feet or moved unless you want to be, and you can stop anything trying to get past you by Keeping Them Busy with +Iron.</p>\n<h2>Playing as the Dwarf</h2>\n<p>The Dwarf is built to last. Their people are the most solidly grounded people this world has to offer. The Dwarf offers you the ability to defend your allies well, clear a path through anything in your way, and keep on chugging in spite of the dangers.</p>\n<p>Play as The Dwarf if you want to be built to take on anything, if you want to outlast the world, if you want to be the toughest person at the table, or if your thirst for treasure outweighs your common sense.</p>\n<h2>Advancement</h2>\n<p><strong>When you Level Up, increase your level by 1, then choose an option from the list and mark it. You may only choose each option once.</strong></p>\n<p><em>You begin the game at level 1.</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Increase your Blood or Wisdom by 1 (to a maximum of +3).</li>\n<li>Increase one of your stats by 1 (to a maximum of +3).</li>\n<li>Take another Dwarven Custom.</li>\n<li>Take another Dwarven Custom, or ask another player to share a Move with you.</li>\n<li>Take another Dwarven Custom, or two more Dwarven Gear options. You cannot choose a Gear option you already have.</li>\n<li>Share one of your Gear options with another player.</li>\n<li>You have Changed. You must be level 5 or higher to take this Advancement.
