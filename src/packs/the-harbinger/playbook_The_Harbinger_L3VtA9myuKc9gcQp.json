I have seen many things. I have known many others. Today, I speak of a great threat to this world. It must be opposed, but we cannot do so divided. Of my kind, I alone will stand against it, but we need true and hearty champions of all the world's peoples if we are to have hope.</em></p>\n<p><em>I know many of this evil's secrets. Do not ask how. Such knowledge was earned painfully. Many have chosen to ignore my warnings, but I beg that you are not among them. To those who have courage, to those who would see this world saved, to those who would be champions, I will guide you.</em></p>\n<p><em>I am the Harbinger, and Doom is coming.</em></p>\n</section>\n<section class=\"rules\">\n<div>\n<h2>Name</h2>\n<p><strong>Choose one or two from each, or make up your own:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Given Names:</strong> Gandall, Weathersky, Belgarath, Ursula, Risewind, Elric, Albus, Merlin, Mesmer, Baba Yaga, Vivi, Gwydion, Morgan, Jadis, Willow</p>\n<p><strong>Titles:</strong> Lightbearer, the Grey, Cursender, of Camelor, Windreaver, Greenhanded, of Twisting Fire, Greyblossom, Blightbringer, the Forsaken, of Red Ashes, in Exile Eternal look</p>\n<h3>Look</h3>\n<p>Choose one from each list, or make up your own:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Flowing Hair, Messy Hair, or Silvery Hair</li>\n<li>Whimsical Robes, Plain Robes, or Very Old Robes</li>\n<li>Cold Eyes, Kind Eyes, or Infinitely Sad Eyes</li>\n<li>Long Scarf, Heavy Hood, or Simple Jewelry</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Agenda</h3>\n<p><strong>When you know not what to do, consult your Agendas.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>You have these three Agendas:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Be Brave, Take Risks</li>\n<li>Tell Us Of Your People</li>\n<li>Improve The World Around You</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>And choose a fourth Agenda that only you follow:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fulfill The Prophecy:</strong> Tell us about ~The Great Prophecies~ and do your best to fulfill them.</li>\n<li><strong>Savior Complex:</strong> Remove evil from this world, at all costs.</li>\n<li><strong>You'll Get Through This:</strong> Protect your allies from harm and danger, no matter what happens to you.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Stats</h3>\n<p>Your <strong>Doom</strong> stat is +2.</p>\n<p>Assign +2, +1, +0, +0, -1 to the others.</p>\n<h2>What is a harbinger?</h2>\n<p><strong>Choose the option that best represents your people:</strong></p>\n<h4>angelic remnants</h4>\n<p>Your people are what remainds of the divine beings who created this world, and your extraordinary powers are what lingers of their gifts. Your Doom will bring salvation.</p>\n<p>When you read the prophecies about someone whose name you know, you may Speak Softly with +Doom instead of +Wisdom, and you do not need to be speaking with them to learn their answers.</p>\n<h4>blind prophets</h4>\n<p>Your fellow wizards see without sight, and you are no different. Even without eyes, you can see more than anyone else. Add the following options to the Wizardry move:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Look through a wall, so long as you touch it</li>\n<li>Look through the eyes of another, so long as you hold something they own aloft in your hands</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h4>principled academia</h4>\n<p>Wizardry comes from a book. Anyone can become a wizard with enough education, and you are among the scholastic elite. Inside your book is limitless power, if you can read the runes right. You have a magical book (2 Uses, Slow) added to your Gear.</p>\n<p>When you consult your magical book on how to perform a magical ritual properly, tell us what you want the ritual to accomplish. It takes several minutes to perform a ritual. Once it is finished, choose one:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It works how you wanted, but won't take effect for some time</li>\n<li>It takes effect immediately, but there is a catch or side effect</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h4>servants of the dark</h4>\n<p>The Harbingers are so-called because they herald the coming of the Overlord, and they serve the Overlord. You are a renegade to your people, outcast, but you still command the same terrifying powers they do. You do not need to pay a price to show others why they Do Not Trifle With Wizards.</p>\n<h2>Playing as the harbinger</h2>\n<p>The Harbinger is a prophet of the end of days. They are magical beings, and they are both very rare and very powerful. A Harbinger never shows up when times are good. You will have more raw power and utility than anyone else, but you tire quickly, make friends poorly, and you cannot do this alone.</p>\n<p>Play as The Harbinger if you want to play the mentor character, if you want to have access to powerful and deadly magic, if you want to be a bit of a loner, or if you want to play a gloomy prophet of the end times.</p>\n<h2>Advancement</h2>\n<p><strong>When you Level Up, increase your level by 1, then choose an option from the list and mark it. You may only choose each option once.</strong></p>\n<p><em>You begin the game at level 1.</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Increase one of your stats by 1 (to a maximum of +3).</li>\n<li>Increase one of your stats by 1 (to a maximum of +2).</li>\n<li>Take another Harbinger Custom.</li>\n<li>Take another Harbinger Custom.</li>\n<li>Take another Harbinger Custom, or one more Harbinger Gear option.</li>\n<li>Take another Harbinger Custom, or ask another player to share a Move with you.</li>\n<li>Take a Custom Move from any Basic or Powerful playbook.</li>\n<li>Take an End of Days, Oracle, or Witch Move.</li>\n<li>Take an End of Days, Oracle, or Witch Custom. You must be level 5 or higher to take this Advancement.</li>\n<li>Take a Custom Move from any Destiny playbook. You must be level 5 or higher to take this Advancement.</li>\n<li>Choose a player. They Share a Move with you.</li>\n<li>You have become a Threat to the World. You must be level 5 or higher to take this Advancement. When facing another Threat to the World, you do not need to pay a price simply to act against them.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Bonds</h2>\n<p>You start with 4 bonds with the other members of the Fellowship. Use these, or make your own:</p>\n<p>I am teaching _____________ the ways of the world.</p>\n<p>_____________ will be of great importance in the events to come.</p>\n<p>I have done many a favor for _____________ .</p>\n<p>I once told ____________ a magnificent story, and they have never forgotten it.</p>\n<p>I have trusted _____________ with a dark secret.</p>\n<p>_____________ is the only person who has ever changed a future I foresaw.</p>\n<p>I have never met anyone more full of life than _____________ .</p>\n<p>My prophecies do not scare _____________ , and for that I am eternally thankful.</p>\n<p>I know the doom that awaits _____________ but I cannot bring myself to tell them.</p>\n<p>_____________ gives me hope for our future.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<h2>Core Moves</h2>\n<p><strong>All Harbinger's have these moves.</strong></p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.fellowship-pbta.the-harbinger.Item.1vbdnqkvSoBj4gUX]{Do not trifle with wizards}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.fellowship-pbta.the-harbinger.Item.89MyBV95FMgkcFdY]{Doom and gloom}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.fellowship-pbta.the-harbinger.Item.TuqcYt0aKldQBv6l]{Doomed soul}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.fellowship-pbta.the-harbinger.Item.0V8jiJWKm9XFz8MM]{Wizardry}</p>\n<h2>Custom Move</h2>\n<p><strong>Choose two of these moves to further define what it means to be a Harbinger.</strong></p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.fellowship-pbta.the-harbinger.Item.fldYbKtGyojHz6qw]{A wizard's word}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.fellowship-pbta.the-harbinger.Item.zj4Uj13hPsM7suuP]{Angel's touch}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.fellowship-pbta.the-harbinger.Item.AAyy8tSfjdR5m4pP]{Cultural appreciation}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.fellowship-pbta.the-harbinger.Item.s1MPfj31Gunb3Dw7]{Dark and terrible}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.fellowship-pbta.the-harbinger.Item.xa7gxTXiHeJF8NLP]{Mysterious fires}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.fellowship-pbta.the-harbinger.Item.7NnQ5ih8XC7AJ2tg]{The evil eye above}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.fellowship-pbta.the-harbinger.Item.9LWbUB0yQIVqYA6M]{Wildspeaker}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.fellowship-pbta.the-harbinger.Item.SHVpF0KcacfMGZpb]{You shall not pass}</p>\n<h2>Gear</h2>\n<p>You start with @UUID[Compendium.fellowship-pbta.the-harbinger.Item.XD1NhKWYcLK9SqB0]{Just enough food} (Food, 2 Uses) and some @UUID[Compendium.fellowship-pbta.the-harbinger.Item.AG6TlFWV5rtc7lGZ]{Wizardly baubles} (Useful, 2 Uses).
