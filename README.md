### An unofficial Fellowship 2E module for Foundry VTT using the PbtA System
Fellowship 2nd Edition is a tabletop role-playing game that emphasizes collaborative storytelling and world-building, inspired by epic journeys like The Lord of the Rings or Avatar: The Last Airbender. Players take on the roles of iconic heroes from distinct cultures, each wielding unique powers and abilities, as they band together to confront a shared adversary, known as the Overlord.

The ideas used in this module are from Fellowship 2E from [Liberi Gothica Games](https://liberigothica.itch.io/) Written by [Vel Mini](https://bsky.app/profile/velimini.bsky.social). You can get the Books at [itch.io](https://liberigothica.itch.io/fellowship-a-tabletop-adventure-game)

This module is for [Foundry VTT](https://foundryvtt.com/) and requires the [PbtA System](https://github.com/asacolips-projects/pbta) created by [asacolips](https://github.com/asacolips).
