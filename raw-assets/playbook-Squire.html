        <p><i>I'm not as much concerned with all these grand sorts of things. I mean, they concern themselves with me often enough - that's what I get for stickin' my neck out - but I'm not gonna' go out of my way for any glory or fame or nothin'. I'm here because, well, it sounds like you need all the help you can get. Even if that help's just me.</i></p>
        <p><i>I'm pretty handy, I suppose, and I know a lot of little tricks to make things easier. I'll keep us on track, no problem. We'll make it to the end of that road, and the return trip, to boot. I'll make sure of it, crossy my heart.</i></p>
        <p><i>Oh, do you need a hand with that? I'm the Squire, let me take care of it for ya'.</i></p>

            <h2>what is your purpose?</h2>
            <p>You do not represent anybody. You're nobody special, you aren't some champion, but you're here for a reason. <b>Choose your purpose:</b></p>
            <h4>keep them safe</h4>
            <p>You are here to make sure they come back home after this is all over, no matter what. When you are with someone you have a Bond with and they take harm, you may take that harm in their place.</p>
            <h4>for your people</h4>
            <p>Your people's champion is just not enough. You're here to keep them honest. Take their What Is A ______? Move, and they can Share any of their moves with you, even Moves that cannot be Shared. Their Core Moves count as Squire Custom moves for you, and you can take them whenever you could take a Squire Custom.</p>
            <h4>see the world</h4>
            <p>You're just here to go on a fun adventure. All this Overlord stuff is just an excuse to see more than your garden, and you're going to make sure you see every- thing there is to see!</p>
            <p>Once per scene, you may ask one question from the Look Closely list without rolling.</p>
            <h4>remembered by history</h4>
            <p>You want to be a hero so bad, even if the only way to do it is to tag along with the real heroes.</p>
            <p>Whenever anyone near you goes anywhere, you can always choose to tag along with them, even if doing so should be impossible.</p>
            
            <h2>Playing as the Squire</h2>
            <p>The Squire isn't supposed to be here. They're here with someone else, to carry the bags, to help keep track of the horses. The Squire looks out for everyone else, makes sure the trip goes smoothly, and often gets in over their head.</p>
            <p>Play as The Squire if you want to be the unlikely hero, the underdog who was given a chance, if you like playing the support character who smoothes out problems, or if you're the quiet type who is fine hanging back and letting the real heroes do most of the work.</p>
            
            <h2>Advancement</h2>
            <p><b>When you Level Up, increase your level by 1, then choose an option from the list and mark it. You may only choose each option once.</b></p>
            <p><i>You begin the game at level 1.</i></p>

                <li>Increase your Courage or Wisdom by 1 (to a max of +3).</li>
                <li>Increase one of your stats by 1 (to a maximum of +3).</li>
                <li>Gain another Squire Custom.</li>
                <li>Gain another Squire Custom, or share a Move with someone. </li>
                <li>Choose a player. They share a Move with you.</li>
                <li>Choose a different player. They share a Move with you.</li>
                <li>You have Changed. You must be level 5 or higher to take this Advancement. When you Change, choose a Destiny you meet the requirements for and take its first Move.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Bonds</h2>
            <p>You start with 4 bonds with the other members of the Fellowship. Use these, or make your own:</p>
