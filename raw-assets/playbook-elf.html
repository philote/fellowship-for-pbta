            <h1>The Elf</h1>
            <p>Basic Playbook</p>
        </div>
        <p><i>I have witnessed many of this world's wonders. I have seen them come, and seen them go. My people have added to them, and taken them away. Our endless lives attain meaning in the pursuit of timeless perfection. Even among such wondrous people as these, I have earned respect, and that is why I have been chosen to defend our great works against this coming evil.</i></p>
        <p><i>We elves may sometimes forget the world, lost in our dreams of beauty and perfection, but the world does not forget us, and we shall not let the world fall. Among all people, not just my Elves, can be found those of some worth. If you will have me, then my arts, my grace, and my wisdom will serve our common cause.</i></p>
        <p><i>I am the Elf. We remember.</i></p>

            <h2>What is an elf?</h2>
            <p><b>Choose the option that best represents your people:</b></p>
            <h4>faerie</h4>
            <p>Your kin are faeries or nature spirits. Tiny and elusive, they have been forgotten by the other peoples of the world, remembered only as myths or legends. Your people can fly, with all the benefits that brings you, but you cannot carry anyone with you. Add this to your Elder Arts list:</p>
            <p><b>Pixie Dust:</b> You grant someone else the ability to fly for the rest of this scene.</p>
            <h4>merfolk</h4>
            <p>Your people are part fish, and the ocean is your homeland. You can breathe underwater, and you can grant this gift temporarily to anyone you share a kiss with. When you use an Elder Art while you have access to a body of water, do not mark it.</p>
            <h4>star elf</h4>
            <p>Your people come from beyond the skies, and your technology is highly advanced. You start with High-Tech Gizmos (2 Uses, Useful, Elf-Made) in your Gear.</p>
            <p>Instead of burning any non-elf who holds them, Elf-Made items electrocute any non-elf attempting to use them without proper training, causing them to pass out where they stand.</p>
            <h4>wood elf</h4>
            <p>Your people are one with the forests and the trees, and they care for you as you care for them.</p>
            <p>When traveling through woodlands, you and your allies cannot be followed by your enemies.</p>
            <p>When you use the Camouflage spell, you may hide any number of allies with you.</p>
            
            <h2>Playing as the elf</h2>
            <p>The Elf is graceful eternity. The elves are long-lived, unnatural, unusual, and, if you ask them, perfect. The Elf offers you the ability to dance around your enemies, show up your allies constantly, and generally be the best around at everything cool and flashy.</p>
            <p>Play as The Elf if you want to shine like a diamond, if you like being stylish and graceful, if you want to be the coolest person at the table, or if you want to play as a mysterious magical being.</p>
            
            <h2>Advancement</h2>
            <p><b>When you Level Up, increase your level by 1, then choose an option from the list and mark it. You may only choose each option once.</b></p>
            <p><i>You begin the game at level 1.</i></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Increase your Blood or Sense by 1 (to a maximum of +3). </li>
                <li>Increase one of your stats by 1 (to a maximum of +3).</li>
                <li>Take a Core or Custom move from any basic playbook. You cannot take a move someone else already knows.</li>
                <li>Take another Elven Custom.</li>
                <li>Take another Elven Custom.</li>
                <li>Choose a player you have 3 Bonds with. Share a Move with them.</li>
                <li>You have Changed. You must be level 5 or higher to take this Advancement. When you Change, choose a Destiny you meet the requirements for and take its first Move.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Bonds</h2>
            <p>You start with 4 bonds with the other members of the Fellowship. Use these, or make your own:</p>
            <p>_____________ has been named a friend to all elves.</p>
            <p>_____________ once helped me with a hunt, and I know we shall hunt again.</p>
            <p>I have trusted _____________ with the truth about me. </p>
            <p>_____________ 's entire family line is respected by the elves. </p>
            <p>_____________ is my rival, and I theirs.</p>
            <p>_____________ defeated me in a contest of skill and I still cannot believe it.</p>
            <p>I have absolute faith in _____________ 's abilities.</p>
            <p>I once went to war alongside _____________ . </p>
            <p>Because of _____________ , I have changed as a person.</p>
            <p>I have taught _____________ the ways of elven _____________ .</p>

            <p><b>Choose a memento of your homeland, it has 1 Use:</b></p>

            </ul>
            <p><b>Record your Nemesis' names here, and cross them off as they die:</b></p>
            
            <h2>Companions</h2>
            <p>Elven companions are those allies who are particularly likely to join arms with you. Many of them are available as Gear options - a Companion in your Gear will always return to you, heal, or be replaced by another when you Recover.</p>
