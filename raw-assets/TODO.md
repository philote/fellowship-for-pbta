# NPC sheet (Threats)
- stats (one to four stats), can be damaged (like health) each one has an associated threat
    Examples: 
        Bloodlust: This threat goes into a frenzy at the sight of blood. If your Blood is damaged, this threat's Cuts against you are Hard Cuts.
        Creepy: This threat is terrifying. If your Courage is damaged, you cannot take a stand against this threat.
        Rampage: This threat is difficult to evade. If your Grace is damaged, you cannot defend against this threat's attacks.
        Charming: This threat is pleasant and fun to be around. If your Sense is damaged, they can distract you for as long as they'd like.
        Persuasive: This threat is hard to deny. If your Wisdom is damaged, you will go along with whatever they say.
        Tough As Nails: The first time this threat would be damaged or destroyed, damage this stat instead.
        Armored: This stat has to be damaged twice.
