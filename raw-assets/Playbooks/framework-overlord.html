<p>The Overlord has rules, just like the fellowship does, but your rules are not the same rules they play by.</p>
<p>Your <b>Principles </b>are hard rules you cannot break. They help you run the game in a fair and fun way, while still playing hardball and giving the players a challenge.</p>
<p>Your <b>Cuts </b>are the main way you influence the game. A Cut is a story-telling weapon you wield, which you can unleash at basically any time you want. Your Cuts control the flow of the game more than anything else, so familiarize yourself with them and use them frequently.</p>
<p>framework</p>
<p><strong>OVERLORD RULES</strong></p>
<p>framework principles</p>
<p>Your <b>Principles </b>are the rules you must follow.</p>
<p><strong>Do not break them.</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Create problems, not solutions.</strong></p>
<p>You&#39;re the bad guy. You make things worse. You make things harder. And then you leave them be. Don&#39;t overthink things or come up with pre-made solutions. If the fellowship has an idea, let their moves decide how it goes.</li><li><strong>Address the characters, not the players.</strong></p>
<p>Don&#39;t call them &quot;Jesse&quot; or &quot;Sam,&quot; call them &quot;Aurora&quot; and &quot;Rumblebelly.&quot;</li><li><strong>Embrace the fantastic.</strong></p>
<p>Don&#39;t let the world be boring. Make the game weird, make the world interesting, give everyone a reason to remember everything they come across.</li><li><strong>Make a move that follows.</strong></p>
<p>When you use a Cut, use one that makes sense. Ask yourself: Which cut makes the most sense? Which cut would cause the most chaos? Which cut would be the most fun? Then use the one you need most - logic, chaos, or fun.</li><li><strong>Never speak the name of your Cut.</strong></p>
<p>Just say what happens.</li><li><strong>Ask questions, use the answers.</strong></p>
<p>Ask them questions, write down the answers, and use those answers later. Make the information they&#39;ve given you matter.</li><li><strong>Be a fan of their characters.</strong></p>
<p>Be cool, let them be cool, and appreciate everyone at the table.</li><li><strong>Pass the Spotlight.</strong></p>
<p>You&#39;re in charge of the Spotlight, so make sure everyone gets a turn. Share the Spotlight, and share it often.</li><li><strong>Think dangerous.</strong></p>
<p>Never be afraid of raising the stakes, increasing the tension, and making things more dangerous and exciting.</li><li><strong>Begin and end with the fiction.</strong></p>
<p>Start a move with what triggered it, end the move with what it accomplished, and then move to the next move from there.</li><li><strong>Think off-screen, too.</strong></p>
<p>Not everything needs to happen right here and right now. The Overlord is always up to something, but it might not be here.</li><li><strong>Don&#39;t shut them down.</strong></p>
<p>Never say &#39;no.&#39; If something is impossible, then <i>Tell Them The Consequences or Requirements.</i></li><li><strong>Be the referee.</strong></p>
<p>If someone doesn&#39;t know what move to make or how to do something within the rules, tell them. Even if you do not know either, tell them. Its better to make the call than ruin the flow by looking up an answer, so make the call, ref.</p>
<p>framework cuts</p>
<p>Your Cuts are story-telling weapons that you use to control the game.</p>
<p>Cuts come in two strengths: <b>Hard Cuts </b>and <b>Soft Cuts.</b></p>
<p>A <b>Soft Cut </b>gives them time to respond. <b>When you make a Soft Cut, </b>before it does anything, you ask someone &quot;So what do you do?&quot; and give them a chance to react to it.</p>
<p><strong>When they look to you for what happens next, when a new scene starts, or when no one knows what is going on, make a Soft Cut that makes sense.</strong></p>
<p>A <b>Hard Cut </b>just happens and there is nothing they can do about it. <b>If you only ever make Soft Cuts, </b>nothing will ever happen, so bring down that hammer.</p>
<p><strong>When a player fails to stop a Soft Cut, when someone rolls a 6 or less, or when you need to scare &#39;em a bit, make a Hard Cut that makes sense.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Your Cuts are:</strong></li><li><strong>Reveal an unwelcome truth.</strong></p>
<p>Tell them something they don&#39;t want to hear.</li><li><strong>Show signs of an approaching threat.</strong></p>
<p>Reveal a new problem they need to deal with.</li><li><strong>Deal damage.</strong></p>
<p>Hurt them. Damage them, damage their companions, damage the places and people they care about. If the pain is right, you can even damage their Bonds. Hurt them.</li><li><strong>Use up or take away their resources.</strong></p>
<p>They have Gear and Companions for a reason. Make them use it, make them lose it, make them burn it up..</li><li><strong>Turn their move back on them.</strong></p>
<p>When their move goes badly, turn it back against them.</li><li><strong>Separate them.</strong></p>
<p>They&#39;re strongest together, so put things between them.</p>
<p>Make them take on the world solo every now and then.</li><li><strong>Put someone on the spot.</strong></p>
<p>Put someone in danger, then make someone else save them.</p>
<p>The key phrase for this Cut is &quot;While you&#39;re doing that...&quot;</li><li><strong>Present an opportunity.</strong></p>
<p>This Cut gives them a break. If you think of something cool they could do right now, present an opportunity to them.</li><li><strong>Show a downside.</strong></p>
<p>Tell them what&#39;s wrong with their plan at the exact worst moment for them to hear about what&#39;s wrong with their plan.</li><li><strong>Tell them the consequences or requirements.</strong></li></ul><p>Sometimes they can&#39;t do what they want without doing or getting something else first, or without great pain or expense. If they want to do the impossible, tell them how much the impossible costs.</p>
<p>threats</p>
<p>Threats are anything you put in the fellowship&#39;s way: your minions, traps, wild beasts, blocked paths, etc.</p>
<p>basic enemies</p>
<p>Enemies and obstacles function similarly to the</p>
<p>fellowship&#39;s Companions. They have a few stats, usually between one and four of them. Each of those stats gives them access to a Threat. A threat is usually a move, with its own trigger and result, but sometimes they are unique rules the enemy has. Threats are like narrower, more specific Cuts that only this particular enemy can use.</p>
<p><strong>When an enemy is damaged, they choose one of their stats and mark it. A damaged stat takes away the attached Threat, so that move or rule doesn&#39;t apply anymore. As enemies take damage, they will become less powerful.</strong></p>
<p><strong>When they take damage and have no more stats to mark, they are Destroyed. Some moves may say they are Destroyed, which does the same thing. When an enemy is Destroyed, they are no longer a threat and will never oppose the fellowship again.</strong></p>
<p>the rule of three</p>
<p>The <b>Rule of Three </b>states:</p>
<p><em>&quot;When three or more enemies work together, they become a Group. When thirty or more work together, they become a Gang. When three hundred or more work together, they become an Army.&quot;</em></p>
<p>This rule gives you the ability to quickly and easily throw large groups of enemies in the fellowship&#39;s way without making things more complicated. To create a Group, Gang, or Army, simply add the appropriate stat to the enemy&#39;s stat block:</p>
<p><strong>Group: This enemy can make moves against two players at once. When this enemy is destroyed, this stat is damaged, or this is their only stat left, replace the Group with two normal enemies.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Gang: This enemy can make moves against everyone at once. When this enemy is destroyed, this stat is damaged, or this is their only stat left, replace the Gang with two Groups of this enemy. This stat can only be damaged by Dangerous or Area attacks.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Army: This enemy can make moves against an entire locations at once, and its attacks have the Area tag. When this enemy is destroyed, this stat is damaged, or this is their only stat left, replace the Army with two Gangs of this enemy. This enemy can only be damaged by Dangerous or Area attacks.</strong></p>
<p>secrets</p>
<p>Secret enemies do not reveal their stats to the fellowship. Normally, they can ask about the stats of any enemy they are facing, and the Overlord must show them all of those stats immediately. <b>When dealing with a Secret enemy, </b>their stats are not revealed until they become relevant or say they are. The fellowship may not even know the enemy is there until they strike!</p>
<p>set pieces</p>
<p>Set Pieces are large, pre-made encounters found in Chapter</p>
<p>7. They are bigger than any single threat, and combine multiple events together to create a multi-stage boss fight, a long connected encounter, a chase scene, an obstacle course, or any other sort of thing you might need. They are designed to potentially carry an entire session by themselves.</p>
<p>Set Pieces are always Secret, as described above. Their stats are never revealed until they become relevant.</p>
<p>a source of power</p>
<p>A Source of Power is something that is extremely valuable,</p>
<p>powerful, or important to this world, for any reason. There are always several of them throughout the world, and each players&#39; people should hold at least one. For example, the Life Tree that all elves draw power from may be a Source of Power, with drastic consequences should the Overlord take it. Sources of Power are usually either hidden away, kept safe by a protector, or are a visible and obvious pride of their kingdom. There is no such thing as a Source of Power that isn&#39;t surrounded by myths and legends stretching back for ages, and at least one player should be able to Command Lore about any given Source of Power you come across. They are not something that should ever fall out of whatever place they are kept, and the Overlord is actively seeking to take</p>
<p>them for herself.</p>
<p>Some example <b>Sources of Power</b>:</p><ul><li>The <b>Colossus</b>, a massive stone creature whose fiery heart could power all sorts of incredible machinery or eldritch rituals.</li><li>The <b>Emerald Skull</b>, an artifact of supreme necromantic power. No one knows exactly what it does, but none who hold it ever hold it for long.</li><li>The <b>First Bird To Fly</b>. So Successful was this creature that it now lives among the stars, as a constellation. Any who can reach it gain unparalleled control over the skies themselves.</li><li>The <b>Wishmaker</b>, a stone obelisk that will grant your fondest desire, but only once, and perhaps not as you&#39;d like.</li><li>The <b>Ruby Eye</b>, an ornate pendant that can see through time. Peering into its depths has driven many an oracle mad.</li><li>The <b>Eternal Torch</b>, the source of all fire. Lesser fires are drawn to it, consumed by it, and its heat has no equal.</li></ul><p>common enemies</p>
<p>These enemies are a useful fallback for any Overlord.</p>
<p>arrow trap</p>
<p><em>Thwip! You&#39;ve been shot! This trap isn&#39;t necessarily</em></p>
<p>mechanical - an archer or gunner in hiding can also be an Arrow Trap. This threat is <b>Secret</b>.</p>
<li><strong>Hidden Trap: When a player in range of the trap makes a move, the Overlord can reveal this trap to make them pay a price. This trap continues to threaten its area until it is damaged. The trap is no longer Secret.</strong></li>
<p>elite trooper</p>
<p>An elite soldier, who inexplicably goes down super easily</p>
<p>and without any trouble. They are usually found in a Group or a Gang and mostly exist to be intimidating.</p>
<li><strong>Storm Trooper: </strong>Elite Troopers never deal damage to the fellowship. They automatically capture anyone they can surround and separate from the group.</li>
<li><strong>Intimidating Armor: No one outside the fellowship will willingly go anywhere guarded by Elite Troopers. When you damage this stat, you may take their armor and wear it as a disguise.</strong></li>
<p>the captain</p>
<p>The Captains leads a well-trained squad, keeping them in</p>
<p>line and making certain they aren&#39;t led astray. A crew led by a Captain is far more clever than your typical gang of baddies.  O <b>Devoted Underlings: </b>Anyone trying to harm or distract the Captain does that to one of the Captain&#39;s allies instead.</p>
<p>The Captain is only vulnerable while alone.</p>
<li><strong>Leadership: </strong>The Captain&#39;s allies cannot be distracted, confused, or separated while the Captain is with them. Elite Troopers under their command can deal damage to the members of the fellowship.</li>
<p>the warmonger</p>
<p>This powerful warrior wants a fight, real bad, and won&#39;t</p>
<p>take no for an answer.</p>
<li><strong>Unstoppable: </strong>The Warmonger&#39;s attacks are always Hard Cuts and cannot be Overcome.</li>
<li><strong>Wildly Reckless: </strong>When the fellowship Keeps Them Busy, the person keeping the Warmonger busy decides the targets of the Warmonger&#39;s Cuts.</li>
<li><strong>Tough as Nails: </strong>The first time the Warmonger would be damaged, damage this stat instead.</li>
<p>In <i>Fellowship, </i>the Overlord and their generals are the scariest guys around. The main thing that makes them different from ordinary enemies are your <b>Overlord Basic Moves, </b>found on this page, Both you and your Generals have access to all of your Overlord Basic Moves.</p>
<p>Unlike the Fellowship Basic Moves, the Overlord Basic Moves never require a roll. If you meet the Trigger, the result just happens, no questions asked.</p>
<p>framework</p>
<p><strong>OVERLORD RULES</strong></p>
<p>basic moves</p>
<p><strong>You and your Generals have all of these moves.</strong></p>
<p>an offer you can&#39;t refuse</p>
<p><strong>When a player gets Taken Out in your presence,</strong></p>
<p>you may give them an offer, for their services, for something they hold, or for the end of their life. They may attempt to negotiate, but you do not need to listen. If they accept, you fulfill the deal and then leave the scene. If they refuse, they must roll +Courage.</p>
<p><strong>On a 6-, you are too terrifying, and they take your offer, against their true desires. On a 7-9, they refuse, and they have one good chance to spite you. They will tell you how. Then, you will tell them what you do to them for it. You may kill them for this.</strong></p>
<p><strong>On a 10+, not only do they spite you, but they manage to escape before you can properly punish them for it, ending the scene with you standing there, alone. Tell us of your rage.</strong></p>
<p>chew the scenery</p>
<p><strong>When you are physically present, you can have the</strong></p>
<p>Spotlight for as long as you like, when you get it. You and your Generals can never be in Despair.</p>
<p>forge a bond</p>
<p>The Overlord does not make friends. <b>When you cause great personal harm to someone or their people, </b><i>Forge a Bond </i>with them. Your Bonds can only be erased by your own Moves, and you can hold any number of Bonds.</p>
<p><b>When you reveal a side of yourself to someone you never intended to share it with, </b>they may <i>Forge a Bond </i>with you. You cannot erase the Bonds they hold with you, no matter how badly you might want to.</p>
<p>threat to the world</p>
<p>You threaten the world and all it stands for. As a</p>
<p><strong>Threat To The World, you have imunity to a variety of moves. When someone who is not a Threat to the World takes direct action against something that is, they must pay a price to do so.</strong></p>
<p>heart of fire</p>
<p><strong>When a player has a Bond with your name in it,</strong></p>
<p>you do not become their Companion, but it still holds sway over you. They may erase that Bond with you at any time to buy themselves reprieve. <b>They choose one: </b>You will show them mercy, tell them something valuable, or ignore them for the time being.</p>
<p>heart of iron</p>
<p><strong>When someone makes a move against you, you</strong></p>
<p>may erase a Bond with them to have them automatically fail their roll, steal the Spotlight from them, and <i>Twist the Knife </i>against them. Your attention is entirely upon them while you use this move - the rest of the fellowship can act without drawing your attention.</p>
<p>A player may force you to use this move before making their roll.</p>
<p>twist the knife</p>
<p><strong>When you speak to someone you have a Bond with</strong></p>
<p><strong>about your history with them, you may force them to relive their pain. They must either pay a price, stand down and get out of your way, or attack you, right now, their choice. No matter what they choose, you make a Hard Cut against them.</strong></p>
<p>your generals</p>
<p>You have a General at your command who follows</p>
<p>your every whim. To create a General, take any threat you like from Chapter 7 and give it the Threat to the World trait.</p>
<p>Your Generals follow you without question and can never become Companions to the fellowship. Generals have all the moves on this page and their own minions.</p>
<p>You have one Bond with each of your Generals, describing why they serve you.</p>
<p><strong>If one of your Generals suffers a significant failure at the fellowship&#39;s hands, you must either execute them, exile them, or give them one last chance. You can only give a General one last chance once.</strong></p>
<p>You begin the game with a single General.</p>
<p><strong>When you could Advance Your Plans, you may recruit a new General instead.</strong></p>
<p>master plan</p>
<p>The Overlord has a basic plan for what to do with this world, but you do not need to know all of the details. The fellowship can attempt to learn your plans, but this should require them to capture a General, undertake a sneaking mission, or earn it through great peril.</p>
<p>You begin the game with two New Plans: write down a source of power you wish to seize, and a community you wish to destroy. All plans start at stage 0.</p>
<p><strong>Whenever the fellowship <em>Recovers </em>or the Overlord <em>Levels Up</em>, you advance your plans. When the fellowship has A Little Downtime, you may advance your plans during your turn, but the fellowship will immediately hear about it if you do.</strong></p>
<p><strong>When you Advance Your Plans, you choose one of them and move it one step forward. You will always have two plans going at once - whenever you have only one plan left, write a second new plan immediately.</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Create A New Plan: Name a Source of Power you wish to seize or a community you wish to destroy, and write it down.</strong></li><li><strong>Begin The Plan: Your forces move into position to act upon your plan. At this point, the fellowship hears that you are up to something, but not what you are doing or where your forces are.</strong></li><li><strong>Execute The Plan: Your forces take action. The fellowship hears about what you are up to, but stopping you now would be very difficult.</strong></li><li><strong>Victory: You seize the source of power, or destroy the name community. A destroyed community no longer grants Fellowship.</strong></li></ol><p><strong>When you could Advance Your Plans, you may instead do one of the following: Heal a damaged Overlord stat, recruit a General, or swap an undamaged Overlord stat for a new Overlord stat. Write the new stat now.</strong></p>

<p>agenda</p>
<p><strong>When you know not what to do,</strong></p>
<p><strong>consult your Agendas.</strong></p>
<p><strong>You have these two Agendas:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Create Opportunities To Do Good</strong></p>
<p>The world is filled with people who need the help of the fellowship. Give them people to save. Give them a broken world, and see how they fix it.</p>
<p><strong>Play To Find Out What Happens</strong></p>
<p>The world is constantly changing and you can never truly know what happens next. Roll with it.</p>
<p>Let the game evolve naturally, with everyone&#39;s input.</p>
<p>Don&#39;t plan anything outside of what the Overlord is doing.</p>
<p><strong>And circle a third Agenda that only you follow.</strong></p>
<p><strong>This Agenda also gives you an extra Cut you can use.</strong></p>
<p><strong>-----Ultimate Power-----</strong></p>
<p>Place wonderful things in jeopardy.</p>
<p><strong>Extra Cut: Show signs of your increasing power</strong></p>
<p>Every time they see you or where you&#39;ve been, it is always worse than last time.</p>
<p><strong>-----World Is Mine-----</strong></p>
<p>Portray a world on the edge of defeat.</p>
<p><strong>Extra Cut: Expand the Overlord&#39;s Grasp</strong></p>
<p>Show them just how far your power stretches. Tell them of another conquered land, another lost battalion, another defeated ally. Your reach always presses onward.</p>
<p><strong>-----Watch The World Burn-----</strong></p>
<p>Fill the world with strange and painful events.</p>
<p><strong>Extra Cut: Leave chaos in the Overlord&#39;s wake</strong></p>
<p>Where the Overlord goes, pain follows. Show chaos, show collateral damage, show the effects of terrible curses.</p>
<p>Choose the option that best represents your people. The option you choose gives you access to that category of enemies in the Overlord&#39;s Toolbox, to serve you and do your bidding in whatever ways you&#39;d like. You may still use the options you do not choose to threaten the fellowship, but they</p>
<p>do not serve the Overlord.</p>
<p>the horde</p>
<p>Your armies are endless, swarming wherever you need them. This army is simply massive, as each enemy is its own swarm or group of enemies, before you get into Groups or Gangs. Nothing can escape their swarming numbers.</p>
<p>the organization</p>
<p>You have an elite group whose membership mirrors that of the fellowship, but twisted. The Organization does not form a proper army, and your forces are basically a large group of mini-bosses. They will compete with the fellowship in a rivalry fashion, racing them to Sources of Power and trying to undermine their plans.</p>
<p>the scourge</p>
<p>You and your armies spread corruption and blight, and those tainted by it join you and your cause. Tell us how your blight spreads, and what it looks like. Your blight leaves corrupted zones, corrupted creatures, and undead warriors wherever it touches.</p>
<p>the titans</p>
<p>Your armies are small in number, but not in stature. Your forces are massive titans, nearly unbeatable without heavy firepower and teamwork. Your army is easily avoided and run away from, but only the heaviest of fortifications and the strongest of armies will slow them, and nothing can stop them.</p>
<p>playing as the overlord</p>
<p>The Overlord is not like the other playbooks. One player will always need to play as the Overlord. You have a different role than the others - while they are heroes, on a quest to save the world, <i>you&#39;re the one they&#39;re saving the world from.</i></p>
<p>Being the Overlord is not easy, and there is a lot you need to know. Read over all of your rules very carefully, because when things get weird, you&#39;re the one who decides how they play out. Play as the Overlord if you want to be the bad guy, with all the power and inevitable defeat comes with it.</p>
<p>overlord&#39;s core</p>
<p>my only weakness!    overlord damage</p>
<p><strong>The Overlord has these moves.</strong></p>
<p>overlord stats</p>
<p>Your stats are not quite the same as the stats of the</p>
<p>fellowship. Your stats are statements of truth about you, which you write in yourself. While they are undamaged, they are true - you are Invincible, or you are Made of Fire. While they are damaged, they are not true - you can be harmed, or your touch does not burn them.</p>
<p>You begin the game with three stats of your own choosing. An Overlord Stat is a word or short phrase naming your advantage, with a short sentence explaining it.</p>
<p>You can write anything you like, but here&#39;s some examples:</li><li><strong>Charming: No one but the fellowship believe you are evil.</strong></li><li><strong>Flight: The ground cannot hold you.</strong></li><li><strong>Invincible: You cannot be hurt.</strong></li><li><strong>Juggernaut: You can throw and break anything you touch.</strong></li><li><strong>Made Of Fire: Your touch burns and scars them.</strong></li><li><strong>Mythical: No one but the fellowship believes you exist.</strong></li><li><strong>Phantom: You can pass through walls, people, and attacks.</strong></li><li><strong>Rich: You can buy anyone and anything that can be bought.</strong></li><li><strong>Terrifying: Where you go, no one holds Hope.</strong></li><li><strong>Unknowable: No one knows your plans or next actions.</strong></li><li><strong>Untouchable: None can touch or hold you.</strong></li><li><strong>Warrior: You are unbeatable in combat.</strong></p>
<p>The fellowship knows each of your stats, and they will need to form a counter-plan against every single one of them. Your undamaged stats are immutable truths that cannot be contradicted by any means.</p>
<p><strong>When you advance your plans,  you may heal a stat instead.</strong></p>
<p><strong>When you seize a new Source of Power,  gain a new stat of your choice. When you gain or lose a Source of Power,  write down which stat that Source of Power is tied to - if you lose or regain that Source of Power in the future, it takes the stat with it.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Write your Overlord Stats here:</strong></p>
<p><strong>You have a Weakness.  There is a single material, item, charm, ritual, or spell that you are vulnerable to. This is your Weakness. Write it here:</strong></p>
<p>The other players will know your Weakness, but the fellowship they are playing as does not. Unless they have something that tells them your Weakness, they will need to discover it through play.</p>
<p><strong>When you are exposed to your Weakness,  one of your stats is immediately damaged, their choice. Your stats and your moves cannot protect you from your Weakness, but it can only hurt you once per scene.</strong></p>
<p>overlord foibles</p>
<p>There is always a catch, when it comes to having unstoppable power. You have some quirks that the fellowship can exploit. You have all of the following vulnerabilities:</li><li><strong>You are arrogant: Every setback is minor and can</strong></p>
<p>be dealt with. Everything is fine and you know you cannot lose.</li><li><strong>You are busy: The fellowship&#39;s destruction is not your actual goal. You have soething you want, and your focus is on getting that. When you personally engage the fellowship, your goal is not to kill them all, but to get them out of your way while you do your thing.</strong></li><li><strong>You are honor bound: When you make a promise, you will always keep it, even against your better interests. This weakness may seem silly, but it makes</strong></li></ul><p>for a better game when you can negotiate or gamble with the heroes and they can trust you to keep your end of the deal.</p>
<p>You are difficult to harm, but it is not impossible. <b>When you would take damage, </b>they must first pay a price for each undamaged stat you have. <b>If  you would be destroyed, </b>instead damage one of your stats at no cost to your attacker. <b>If you take damage or are destroyed while none of your stats remain, you are finally defeated, </b>once and for all. There is no coming back for you.</p>
<p>Your supreme power comes with some downsides. Most notably, they can harm you without ever being near you. <b>If the fellowship seizes a Source of Power, </b>they may use it to erase one of your stats forever. You can never get that stat back unless you can take control of that specific Source of Power.</p>
<p><strong>When the fellowship Recovers,  heal one of your damaged stats.</strong></p>
<p>cut them real bad</p>
<p><strong>When you are physically present, your Cuts can be as hard as you like.</strong></p><h1 >When an Overlord stat is damaged, mark the box. Overlord stats are always true unless they are damaged.</h1><p><em>They have formed a fellowship. They believe it will be enough to stop me. I cannot wait to see them try. It will be delicious, seeing the best this world has to offer fall before my feet.</em></p>
<p><em>The world is mine, to do with as I please. I am the Overlord, and all things will bow down to me.</em></p>
<p>the overlord</p>
<p><strong>FRAMEWORK PLAYBOOK</strong></p>
<p>overlord bonds</p>
<p>You start with one Bond with each member of the fellowship. Each other player writes their name into one of these Bonds:</p>
<p>I destroyed <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </u> &#39;s hometown.</p>

<p><strong>Record your other bonds here:</strong></p>
<p>overlord&#39;s gear</p>
<p>You do not need to eat, and you do not want for companions.</p>
<p><strong>When the fellowship Recovers,  you also Recover your Gear.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Choose your weapons, as many as you need:</strong></p>
<li>An elegant sword, exotic in design <em>(Melee).</em></li>
<li>A massive weapon, larger than anyone else could wield</li>
<p><em>(Melee)</em></p>
<li>Your bare hands, able to crush stone or pierce metal <em>(Melee)</em></li>
<li>Magical bolts of energy, able to be reflected back at you</li>
<p><em>(Ranged)</em></p>
<li>Destructive blasts of fire or lightning <em>(Dangerous)</em></li>
<p><strong>Choose two defenses:</strong></p>
<li>A clever plan <i>(1 Use). </i>Use this to reveal a trap or escape route just as you make use of it.</li>
<li>A powerful special attack <i>(1 Use). </i>Be sure to name it! You can Use this instead of erasing a Bond to trigger <i>Heart of Iron.</i></li>
<li>A trick up your sleeve <i>(Useful, 1 Use). </i>Use this to produce anything you could possbly need, right now.</li>
<li>A traitor <i>(1 Use). </i>Use this to make anyone in the scene who is not a part of the fellowship reveal their allegiance to you, complete with a dramatic moment</li>
<p>where they betray the fellowship and cause them trouble.</p>
<p><strong>Choose the secret reason you&#39;re doing all of this. You do not have to tell the fellowship your choice.</strong></p>
<li>You have a sympathetic backstory of loss and tragedy. It does not justify your actions, except to yourself. You gain a Bond with anyone who listens to some of your backstory, but they also gain a Bond with you.</li>
<li>It is not you who does all this, but something that is controlling you - a dark master in the shadows, an evil artifact corrupting whoever holds it, or an even greater threat you are trying to destroy yourself. When the fellowship defeats you, reveal this new threat. It&#39;s their problem now.</li>
<li>You are a part of a recurring cycle, and you know you are destined to be defeated. If you could only convince the fellowship to listen to you, maybe you could break the cycle once and for all... But the heroes never listen to you.</li>
<li>You don&#39;t have a secret. You&#39;re just an evil jerk with way too much power.</li>
<p>overlord&#39;s custom</p>
<p><strong>You do not start with any custom moves, and you must gain them by leveling up.</strong></p>
<p>and in the darkness, bind them</p>
<p>You have crafted an item of power. Choose one of your Overlord stats, then give this item of power to one of your Generals. Whoever holds this item of power also has that Overlord stat.</p>
<p><strong>If any of the fellowship gets their hands on it, they gain all the power that it brings, but it will also fill their mind with dark thoughts. They gain the Agenda:</strong></p>
<p>destroy trust</p>
<p><strong>When you dismiss, mock, or show how weak the Bond two people share is, erase those Bonds.</strong></p>
<p>evil&#39;s touch</p>
<p>Damage dealt by you and your Generals is Necrotic. <b>When you or your Generals damage a Companion, </b>you may destroy them instead. Tell us what this looks like and what this means.</p>
<p>fear me!</p>
<p><strong>When you menace someone, they will always do as you say or run in terror, their choice. When you use this Move on someone in the fellowship, they may pay a price to prevent this Move from working on them for the rest of the scene.</strong></p>

<p><b>When you deal damage to someone you have a Bond with or who has a Bond with you, </b>make another Hard Cut against them immediately. The extra Cut cannot be <i>deal damage</i>.</p>

<p>You now have three Master Plans at once instead of</p>
<p>two. Write a new plan immediately, then advance all of your current plans one step.</p>
<p>no more games</p>
<p><strong>When you next face off with the fellowship, as soon as the talking is done, one of them is immediately Taken Out (ask for a volunteer). They take damage to all of their stats and they are out for the rest of the scene. The rest of the fellowship cannot oppose you this scene, and you get away with what you want before taunting them and leaving.</strong></p>
<p>now who told you that?</p>
<p><strong>When the players use your Weakness against you, erase that Weakness and choose a new one. The old Weakness was either lies and misinformation, or you have grown past it and it no longer harms you as it once did.</strong></p>
<p><strong>After you use this Move once, it is gone forever.</strong></p>
<p>team rocket</p>
<p>Choose up to three minions from your Army and name them. <b>When they work together, </b>these minions cannot be damaged or destroyed - whenever one of them would be, they all retreat from the scene. This group will tenaciously follow the fellowship for the rest of the campaign, informing you of where they are and what they&#39;ve done recently. <b>If the fellowship recruits them as Companions, </b>it is only temporary - you can erase all Bonds the fellowship holds with them at any time.</p>
<p>warmonger</p>
<p>Choose another option from the Overlord&#39;s Armies list. You have acquired that army as well.</p>
<p>you&#39;ve met with a terrible fate, haven&#39;t you?</p>
<p><b>When a player gets Taken Out in your presence, </b>you may leave a curse upon them instead of making <i>An Offer They Can&#39;t Refuse</i>. Tell us the nature of the curse, and what must be done to lift it. Whatever curse you give them, it cannot stop them from continuing to play as their character unless they want a new one.</p><h4 >After you use this Move once, it is gone forever.</h4><p>overlord&#39;s advancement</p>

<p><strong>When you Level Up, increase your level by 1, then do all of the following:</strong></p>
<p><em>You begin the game at level 1.</em></p><ul><li><strong>Choose one: Gain an Overlord Custom or recruit a General, gaining a Bond with them immediately.</strong></li><li>Forge a Bond with anyone, fellowship or otherwise.
