    <h2>what is a dwarf?</h2>
    <p><strong>Choose the option that best represents your people:</strong></p>
    <h3>deepdelve</h3>
    <p>Your people dig deeper than any others, and the secrets of the earth are yours. You can see in total darkness without a problem, and your armor is born of the secrets that can only be found deep underground.</p>
    <p>Add The Secrets <i>(3 Uses) </i>to your Gear. You can Use them at any time to immediately ask one question from the <i>Look Closely</i> or <i>Speak Softly </i>lists.</p>
    <h3>firebeard</h3>
    <p>Your people lead a war-like life, with a long history of bloodshed and tragedy. Your armor has seen many battles, and it has seen you through all of them. <b>When you attempt to defeat an enemy in glorious combat, </b>you may damage your Blood to try to <i>Finish Them </i>with +Blood or +Sense.</p>
    <h3>ironblast</h3>
    <p>Your people are madcap inventors and chemists, known throughout the world for their wondrous, and dangerous, creations. Your armor is of unusual design, with many bits and pieces that serve no obvious purpose.</p>
    <p>Add Various Explosive Devices <i>(2 Uses, Dangerous) </i>to your Gear. You can Use your explosives to create an explosion wherever you need it, as long as you could have conceivably planted them ahead of time.</p>
    <h3>stoneborn</h3>
    <p>Your kin have more in common with the earth and stone than they do with flesh and blood. Your armor is your bare skin, solid as stone.</p>
    <p><strong>When you stand on solid ground,</strong> you cannot be knocked off your feet or moved unless you want to be, and you can stop anything trying to get past you by <i>Keeping Them Busy</i> with +Iron.</p>

    <h2>playing as the dwarf</h2>
    <p>The Dwarf is built to last. Their people are the most solidly grounded people this world has to offer. The Dwarf offers you the ability to defend your allies well, clear a path through anything in your way, and keep on chugging in spite of the dangers.</p>
    <p>Play as The Dwarf if you want to be built to take on anything, if you want to outlast the world, if you want to be the toughest person at the table, or if your thirst for treasure outweighs your common sense.</p>

    <h2>dwarven core</h2>
    <p><strong>All Dwarves have these moves.</strong></p>
    <h3>people of stone</h3>
    <p>The dwarves are built tough. You have a sixth stat, Iron, and you have an additional +1 to assign among your other stats. Iron represents your supreme toughness - your armor, survivability, iron gut, and stubbornness.</p>
    <p><strong>When you <em>Finish Them </em>by outlasting them in a contest of power or endurance,</strong> roll +Iron. <b>On a 10+</b>, they pass out.</p>
    <p><strong>When you share this Move with another,</strong>  their Iron stat is +1.</p>
    <p><strong>When someone who does not have an Iron stat uses a Move that rolls +Iron,</strong>  they roll at +0.</p>
    <h3>clear the path (iron)</h3>
    <p><strong>When you charge through something standing in between you and where you&#39;re going,</strong> roll +Iron.</p>
    <p><strong>On a 7+,</strong> you charge through and leave a path for your allies to follow.</p>
    <p><strong>On a 9-,</strong> your reckless charge causes problems. You have to go alone, or leave yourself open to danger, or damage something important, your choice.</p>
    <h3>unbreakable</h3>
    <p><strong>When you <em>Fill Your Belly</em>,</strong>  you also heal your Iron stat.</p>

    <h2>dwarven custom</h2>
    <p><strong>Choose two of these moves to further define what it means to be a Dwarf.</strong></p>
    <h3>all that glitters</h3>
    <p><strong>When you have a bad feeling about this and say as much,</strong> you may ask the Overlord &quot;Is there a trap or ambush here? If so, where would it come from?&quot; They will answer honestly.</p>
    <h3>dig deep</h3>
    <p>Your people are famous for their ability to dig quickly and safely. You can <i>Clear the Path </i>right through earth and stone, digging out a tunnel anyone can use. It will take some time, but not as long as anyone else would expect it to.</p>
    <h3>earth friend</h3>
    <p>You can speak to the mountains and hear the words of the stones. <strong>When you <em>Speak Softly </em>with the earth,</strong> you may use one of your questions to ask it to move for you. For you, the earth can create pits or one-room caves, collapse or clear stone passageways, or leave behind a message that only dwarves will notice.</p>
    <h3>good for what ales you</h3>
    <p><strong>When you use an item with the Drunk tag,</strong> act as though it had the Healing tag instead.</p>
    <h3>greed is good</h3>
    <p><strong>When you desire a treasure or valuable item you have seen or heard of,</strong> you may declare it to be the object of your greed. <b>When you act directly to secure the object of your greed for yourself,</b> you are filled with Hope. You cannot choose a new object of your greed until you have acquired your current one, or it becomes unattainable.</p>
    <h3>half-dwarf</h3>
    <p>Take a Custom Move from any basic playbook.</p>
    <p>You may also take an Agenda from the chosen playbook.</p>
    <p><strong>This move cannot be shared.</strong></p>
    <h3>let me see that</h3>
    <p><strong>When you take a few moments to handle or examine an interesting item, vehicle, or architecture,</strong> ask the Overlord two of the following questions. They must answer truthfully.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Who made this and why should I care about them?</li>
        <li>What was this made to do, and how do I use it or break it?</li>
        <li>What&#39;s wrong with this, and how might I fix it?</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>warrior&#39;s pride (blood)</h3>
    <p><strong>When you let out a roar of challenge,</strong>  tell us who you are challenging and roll +Blood.</p>
    <p><strong>On a 7+,</strong> they accept, approaching you for battle and dropping whatever they were doing.</p>
    <p><strong>On a 9-,</strong> they bring backup with them.</p>

    <h2>dwarven advancement</h2>
    <h3>level</h3>
    <p><strong>When you Level Up, increase your level by 1, then choose an option from the list and mark it. You may only choose each option once.</strong> <i>You begin the game at level 1.</i></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Increase your Blood or Wisdom by 1 (to a maximum of +3).</li>
        <li>Increase one of your stats by 1 (to a maximum of +3).</li>
        <li>Take another Dwarven Custom.</li>
        <li>Take another Dwarven Custom, or ask another player to share a Move with you.</li>
        <li>Take another Dwarven Custom, or two more Dwarven Gear options. You cannot choose a Gear option you already have.</li>
        <li>Share one of your Gear options with another player.</li>
        <li><strong>You have Changed.</strong> You must be level 5 or higher to take this Advancement. <b>When you Change,</b> choose a Destiny you meet the requirements for and take its first Move.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>I have seen the bones of this world. The winds, howling against the mountains. Like the mountains, the Dwarves will never fall. We have endured. We will endure. But we know nothin&#39; lasts forever. This threat you called us all here for, we feel it. We know it&#39;s comin&#39;. Tha&#39;s why I came, why I was chosen to represent my people.</em></p>
    <p><em>Like a crop farmer takes winter, like an anvil takes blows, like a mountain takes an avalanche, so too shall I take this comin&#39; darkness. The Dwarves will never fall, never yield, and never surrender.</em></p>
    <p><em>I am the Dwarf. I can take it. Just you try me.</em></p>
    
    <h2>bonds</h2>

    <h2>what is an elf?</h2>
    <p>Choose the option that best represents your people:</p>
    <h3>faerie</h3>
    <p>Your kin are faeries or nature spirits. Tiny and elusive, they have been forgotten by the other peoples of the world, remembered only as myths or legends. Your people can fly, with all the benefits that brings you, but you cannot carry anyone with you. Add this to your <i>Elder Arts </i>list:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Pixie Dust: </strong>You grant someone else the ability to fly for the rest of this scene.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>merfolk</h3>
    <p>Your people are part fish, and the ocean is your homeland. You can breathe underwater, and you can grant this gift temporarily to anyone you share a kiss with. <strong>When you use an <i>Elder Art </i>while you have access to a body of water,</strong> do not mark it.</p>
    <h3>star elf</h3>
    <p>Your people come from beyond the skies, and your technology is highly advanced. You start with High-Tech Gizmos (2 Uses, Useful, Elf-Made) in your Gear.</p>
    <p>Instead of burning any non-elf who holds them, Elf-Made items electrocute any non-elf attempting to use them without proper training, causing them to pass out where they stand.</p>
    <h3>wood elf</h3>
    <p>Your people are one with the forests and the trees, and they care for you as you care for them.</p>
    <p><strong>When traveling through woodlands,</strong> you and your allies cannot be followed by your enemies.</p>
    <p><strong>When you use the <i>Camouflage </i>spell,</strong> you may hide any number of allies with you.</p>

    <h2>playing as the elf</h2>
    <p>The Elf is graceful eternity. The elves are long-lived, unnatural, unusual, and, if you ask them, perfect. The Elf offers you the ability to dance around your enemies, show up your allies constantly, and generally be the best around at everything cool and flashy.</p>
    <p>Play as The Elf if you want to shine like a diamond, if you like being stylish and graceful, if you want to be the coolest person at the table, or if you want to play as a mysterious magical being.</p>

    <h2>elven core</h2>
    <p>All Elves have these moves.</p>
    <h3>elder arts</h3>
    <p><strong>When you draw upon the elven power that humans sometimes call magic,</strong>  choose a spell from below, then mark it. You cannot use a spell while it is marked.</p>

    <p><strong>When you <i>Recover</i>,</strong> remove all marks on your spells.</p>

        <li><strong>Keen Senses: </strong> Ask a single question about your surroundings, and immediately receive a truthful answer.</li>
        <li><strong>Sense Magic: </strong> Immediately know what here is magical and where it is. If there is nothing magical here, you do not mark this spell.</li>
        <li><strong>Whisper on the Wind: </strong> Send a message to someone you have a Bond with. They will hear it whispered in their ears moments after you send it, and they can send a reply of up to 5 words.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>When you Share this move with another,  they choose a single spell from the list. That spell is the only one they can use.</strong></p>
    <p>You can Share this move with someone multiple times. Each time you do, they learn another of your spells.</p>
    <h3>touch the world lightly</h3>
    <p>You can safely walk on top of snow, across thin tree branches, along precarious ledges, or on top of held weaponry. You can also run along walls, up trees, or across treacherous surfaces safely, although only for short distances.</p>

    <h3>elfsight</h3>
    <p>Your eyes are unnaturally good, and you can see fine detail even through the darkest night or densest fog. <strong>When you <i>Look Closely</i>,</strong> you may study any location you can see, no matter how distant, as if you were standing right there.</p>

    <p><strong>This Move cannot be Shared.</strong></p>
    <h3>enchanting performance (grace)</h3>
    <p><strong>When you perform an Elven art for an attentive audience,</strong> roll +Grace.</p>
    <p><b>On a 10+, </b>you may <i>Forge a Bond </i>with as many audience members as you&#39;d like. The Bond should relate to how much they adore and appreciate you.</p>
    <p><b>On a 7-9, </b>you may only <i>Forge a Bond </i>with a single listener.</p>
    <p><strong>On a 6-,</strong> no one cares.</p>
    <h3>enemy at the gates (grace)</h3>
    <p><b>When you are hidden from your target and wield a ranged weapon, </b>you can spend 1 Ammo to <i>Finish Them </i>with +Grace. <b>If you get a 10+, </b>you remain hidden.</p>

    <h3>special stardust</h3>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Sleep Tight: </strong>You put someone straight to sleep. It is a normal sleep, and they are woken up by anything that would awaken a sleeping person.</li>
        <li><b>When you Share this Move, </b>the ally you share it with gains the <i>Elder Arts </i>move as well, but Sleep Tight is the only spell they know. They do not gain your other <i>Elder Arts</i>.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>way with words</h3>
    <p><strong>When you <i>Speak Softly </i>with someone who admires or fears you,</strong> you may roll at +Grace instead of +Wisdom.</p>
    <p><strong>When you <i>Speak Softly, </i></strong>you may also ask, &quot;What do they desire most?&quot; regardless of the result of your roll.</p>
    
    <h2>elven advancement</h2>

    <p><em>I have witnessed many of this world&#39;s wonders. I have seen them come, and seen them go. My people have added to them, and taken them away. Our endless lives attain meaning in the pursuit of timeless perfection. Even among such wondrous people as these, I have earned respect, and that is why I have been chosen to defend our great works against this coming evil.</em></p>
    <p><em>We elves may sometimes forget the world, lost in our dreams of beauty and perfection, but the world does not forget us, and we shall not let the world fall. Among all people, not just my Elves, can be found those of some worth. If you will have me, then my arts, my grace, and my wisdom will serve our common cause.</em></p>

    <h3>You have these three Agendas:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Be Brave, Take Risks</li>
        <li> Tell Us Of Your People</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>what is a halfling?</h2>
    <p>Choose the option that best represents your people:</p>
    <h3>clever storytellers</h3>
    <p>Your people love to collect stories from afar, and they love to share. You know just how to get someone to tell you what you want to hear.</p>
    <p><strong>When you <i>Speak Softly </i>over stories and games,</strong> you may take the 7-9 result without rolling. <strong>If you also used Halfling Pipeleaf,</strong> take the 10+ result instead.</p>
    <p><strong>When you Speak Softly and get a 6-,  you may ask one less question. If you do,  they do not get to refuse to answer one of your questions.</strong></p>
    <h3>determined survivors</h3>
    <p>Your people have suffered many setbacks and tragedies, and they have never stopped you yet. You know exactly when to stand your ground and exactly when to bail.</p>
    <p><strong>When you <i>Get Away </i>or <i>Keep Them Busy </i>and get a 6-,</strong>  you may instead use the other Move as if you rolled a 7-9.</p>
    <h3>mischievous tricksters</h3>
    <p>Your people love surprises, and they are natural tricksters. The pranks they play are legendary.</p>
    <p><strong>When you <i>Sting Like A Bee</i>,</strong> choose two options instead of one.</p>
    <h3>traveling nomads</h3>
    <p>Your people are travelers, never sticking in one place for long.</p>
    <p><strong>When picking your Gear,</strong> choose one more option from each list - you came prepared for anything.</p>
    
    <h2>playing as the halfling</p>
    <p>The Halfling is a troublemaker. You are tiny, underestimated, the underdog, and relatively unknown. The Halfling is a tricksy sort. You&#39;ll pop up where they least expect you and you&#39;ll do much more than anyone else thinks you can.</p>
    <p>Play as The Halfling if you want to sneak around, if you want to play tricks on your enemies, if you like finding alternative solutions, or if your idea of a good time is partying and food.</p>

    <h2>halfling core</h2>
    <p><strong>All Halflings have these moves.</strong></p>
    <h3>the little folk (courage)</h3>
    <p><strong>When you do something clever or sneaky while no one is looking,  roll +Courage.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>On a 7+,  you do it, and no one notices right away.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>On a 9-,  everyone knows you did it, as soon as they notice what you did.</strong></p>
    <h3>sting like a bee</h3>
    <p><strong>When you <i>Keep Them Busy </i>by getting in close and get a 7+,</strong> choose one.</p>
    <p>You can only <i>Sting Like A Bee </i>against those who are larger than you.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You get them to chase you around, and you both leave the scene.</li>
        <li>You steal something small from them, and they don&#39;t notice until they need it or you taunt them with it.</li>
        <li>You get them talking - ask a question from the <i>Speak Softly </i>list.</li>
        <li>You think fast - ask a question from the <i>Look Closely</i> list.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>halfling custom</h2>
    <p><strong>Choose two of these moves to further define what it means to be a Halfling.</strong></p>
    <h3>a friendly face</h3>
    <p>You are small and easily trusted. <b>So long as you show a friendly face, </b>anyone not already actively hostile towards you will treat you as a friend, until proven otherwise.</p>
    <h3>bottomless belly</h3>
    <p><strong>Whenever you <i>Fill Your Belly</i>,</strong> you may Use as much food as you like, and you heal an equal amount of damage. Anyone trying to compete with you can also Use one extra food to heal an extra point of damage.</p>
    <h3>half-a-halfling</h3>
    <p>Take a Custom Move from any basic playbook.</p>
    <p>You may also take an Agenda from the chosen playbook.</p>
    <p><strong>This move cannot be shared.</strong></p>
    <h3>lived in a shoe</h3>
    <p>You can change size at will, shrinking down to the size of an apple or growing as tall as a good chair but you usually stay at a happy medium you&#39;re comfortable in.</p>
    <h3>small target</h3>
    <p><strong>When you Overcome an enemy by getting out of their way, on a 7+,</strong> you manage to get completely out of sight - your attacker loses track of you, although you must still pay a price on a 7-9 result. <b>On a 12+,</b> <i>everyone </i>loses track of you - tell us where you went, and you&#39;re there.</p>
    <h3>talk nonsense (courage)</h3>
    <p><strong>When you <i>Talk Sense </i>by telling grandiose lies with a straight face,</strong> roll +Courage.</p>
    <p><strong>When you <i>Talk Sense </i>and get a 10+,</strong> you may also <i>Sting Like A Bee.</i></p>
    <h3>the courage of halflings</h3>
    <p>You are never in Despair when rolling Courage, even if it is damaged.</p>
    <p><strong>This move cannot be Shared.</strong></p>
    <h3>who&#39;s the tough guy now, tough guy?</h3>
    <p><strong>When you <i>Overcome </i>an enemy and get a 7+,</strong> you may <em>Sting Like A Bee.</em></p>
    <p><strong>When you could <i>Finish Them</i>,</strong> you may <i>Keep Them Busy</i> as if you got a 10+ instead.</p>
    
    <h2>halfling advancement</h2>
    <h3>level</h3>
    <p><strong>When you Level Up, increase your level by 1, then choose an option from the list and mark it. You may only choose each option once.</strong> <em>You begin the game at level 1.</em></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Increase your Grace or Sense by 1 (to a maximum of +3).</li>
        <li>Increase one of your stats by 1 (to a maximum of +3).</li>
        <li>Take another Halfling Custom.</li>
        <li>Take another Halfling Custom, or choose another Move from the list of <i>What Is A Halfling? </i>options.</li>
        <li>Share one of your Moves or Gear options with another player.</li>
        <li>Choose a player you have 3 Bonds with. They share one of their Moves or Gear options with you.</li>
        <li><strong>You have Changed.</strong> You must be level 5 or higher to take this Advancement. <b>When you Change,</b> choose a Destiny you meet the requirements for and take its first Move.</li>    
    </ul>

    <p><em>I have kept the good things secret and safe. We&#39;re small, often we&#39;ll go unnoticed, but any bully will pick on the weakest folks they can find. That&#39;s where I come in. I lead danger away, sling rocks at it, taunt it, trick it, you name it! If they won&#39;t pick on someone their own size, you can&#39;t expect me to play fair, can you?</em></p>
    <p><em>We like to duck out heads, enjoy our pleasures, and live our lives peacefully inside of our comfortable little nooks. Comfort, safety, security - they&#39;re what&#39;s important, you know? So that&#39;s what I stand for, if you&#39;ll have me.</em></p>

    <h2>what is a harbinger?</h2>
    <p><strong>Choose the option that best represents your people:</strong></p>
    <h3>angelic remnants</h3>
    <p>Your people are what remainds of the divine beings who created this world, and your extraordinary powers are what lingers of their gifts. Your Doom will bring salvation.</p>
    <p><b>When you read the prophecies about someone whose name you know, </b>you may <i>Speak Softly </i>with +Doom instead of +Wisdom, and you do not need to be speaking with them to learn their answers.</p>
    <h3>blind prophets</h3>
    <p>Your fellow wizards see without sight, and you are no different. Even without eyes, you can see more than anyone else.</p>
    <p><strong>Add the following options to the <em>Wizardry </em>move:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Look through a wall, so long as you touch it</li>
        <li>Look through the eyes of another, so long as you hold something they own aloft in your hands</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>principled academia</h3>
    <p>Wizardry comes from a book. Anyone can become a wizard with enough education, and you are among the scholastic elite. Inside your book is limitless power, if you can read the runes right. You have a magical book <i>(2 Uses, Slow) </i>added to your Gear.</p>
    <p><strong>When you consult your magical book on how to perform a magical ritual properly,</strong> tell us what you want the ritual to accomplish. It takes several minutes to perform a ritual.</p>
    <p>Once it is finished, <b>choose one:</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>It works how you wanted, but won&#39;t take effect for some time</li>
        <li>It takes effect immediately, but there is a catch or side effect</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>servants of the dark</h3>
    <p>The Harbingers are so-called because they herald the coming of the Overlord, and they serve the Overlord. You are a renegade to your people, outcast, but you still command the same terrifying powers they do. You do not need to pay a price to show others why they <i>Do Not Trifle With Wizards</i>.</p>
    
    <h2>playing as the harbinger</h2>
    <p>The Harbinger is a prophet of the end of days. They are magical beings, and they are both very rare and very powerful. A Harbinger never shows up when times are good. You will have more raw power and utility than anyone else, but you tire quickly, make friends poorly, and you cannot do this alone.</p>
    <p>Play as The Harbinger if you want to play the mentor character, if you want to have access to powerful and deadly magic, if you want to be a bit of a loner, or if you want to play a gloomy prophet of the end times.</p>

    <h2>harbinger&#39;s core</p>
    <p><strong>All Harbingers have these moves.</strong></p>
    <h3>doomed soul</h3>
    <p>The Harbingers are the keepers of prophecy and magic, and their soul is unlike any other. You have a sixth stat, Doom, and an additional +0 to assign between your stats. <b>When your Doom stat gets damaged by an enemy attack, </b>you must damage another one of your stats.</p>
    <p><strong>When you <em>Finish Them </em>by relying on fate or luck,</strong> roll +Doom. On a 10+,  their fate is sealed. The Overlord player decides what happens to them.</p>
    <p><strong>When you Share this Move with another,</strong> their Doom stat is +1.</p>
    <h3>doom and gloom</h3>
    <p>Your Doom makes you hard for others to relate to.</p>
    <p>You can never have more than one Bond with someone, and others can never have more than one Bond with you.</p>
    <p><strong>This Move cannot be Shared.</strong></p>
    <h3>do not trifle with wizards</h3>
    <p>Your magic is dangerous and powerful, for both you and your enemies.</p>
    <p><strong>When you conjure a powerful spell to destroy something in your way,</strong> pay a price, then take up to three points of damage. You inflict that much damage to your target. You then become exhausted, and roll with Despair for the rest of the scene.</p>
    <p><strong>Threats to the World </strong> and <b>Set Pieces</b> take no damage from this Move.</p>
    <p><strong>This Move cannot be Shared.</strong></p>
    <h3>wizardry</h3>
    <p><strong>When you draw upon the magic inherent to your people,</strong> choose one option from below. You may use these spells as often as you need to. <b>When you use one of these magical effects,</b> tell us how it manifests - what does it look like, what does it sound like? What do you need to do to make this happen?</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Conjure a soft light, which floats around you.</li>
        <li>Deliver a message through mysterious means.</li>
        <li>Speak, look, or listen as if you were somewhere else that you can see.</li>
        <li>Touch, push, or grab as if you were somewhere else that you can see.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>When you Share this Move with another,</strong> they choose a single spell from the list. That spell is the only one they can use. You can Share this Move with someone multiple times. Each time you do, they learn another of your spells.</p>

    <h2>harbinger&#39;s custom</h2>
    <p><strong>Choose one of these moves to further define what it means to be a Harbinger.</strong></p>
    <h3>angel&#39;s touch</h3>
    <p>You can heal the wounds of an ally with a touch, although it takes a lot out of you.</p>
    <p>You gain the tags (Healing, 1 Use).</p>
    <p><strong>When you heal someone,</strong> you may damage yourself to heal them again.</p>
    <p><strong>When you <em>Fill Your Belly</em>,</strong> restore this Use.</p>
    <h3>a wizard&#39;s word</h3>
    <p><strong>When you make a promise to someone and they promise something in return,</strong> you may leave your mark upon them. <b>So long as you do not break your promise,</b> they cannot break theirs.</p>
    <p>Write a Bond with them describing the promise you share. The mark is undone when they fulfill their end of the promise, or you break your end of it.</p>
    <h3>cultural appreciation</h3>
    <p>Take a Custom Move from any basic playbook.</p>
    <p>You may take an Agenda from the chosen playbook.</p>
    <p><strong>This Move cannot be Shared.</strong></p>
    <h3>dark and terrible</h3>
    <p><strong>When you denounce the deeds of another,</strong> you may take one damage to leave a curse upon them. Tell us the nature of this curse, and what must be done to lift it.</p>
    <h3>mysterious fires</h3>
    <p><strong>Add the following option to the <em>Wizardry </em>move:</strong><
    <ul>
        <li>Start a fire on something flammable that you can see. The fire starts small, but it will grow rapidly if left unchecked.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>the evil eye above</h3>
    <p>Doom follows you, but you are ready for it. <b>When the minions of the Overlord approach, </b>the Overlord&#39;s player must tell you before they arrive.</p>
    <p><strong>When you know the Overlord&#39;s plans,</strong> you may ask them, &quot;What is one way I could stop this?&quot; They must answer truthfully.</p>
    <h3>wildspeaker</h3>
    <p>You speak the language of beasts and monsters.</p>
    <p><b>When you try to speak to such a creature for the first time, </b>they will always pause to listen and reply, and you always have a chance to <i>Speak Softly </i>or <i>Talk Sense </i>with them.</p>
    <h3>you shall not pass</h3>
    <p><strong>When you <em>Keep Them Busy </em>and get a 10+,</strong> you may pay a price to hold them off indefinitely - it will be impossible for them to follow or approach you for the rest of the scene. Tell us how your magic or their fate has stepped in to hold them off.</p>

    <h2>harbinger&#39;s advancement</p>
    <h3>level</h3>
    <p><strong>When you Level Up, increase your level by 1, then choose an option from the list and mark it. You may only choose each option once.</strong> <em>You begin the game at level 1.</em></p>

    </ul>

    <p><em>I have walked this land long. I have seen many things. I have known many others. Today, I speak of a great threat to this world. It must be opposed, but we cannot do so divided.

    <p><em>I know many of this evil&#39;s secrets. Do not ask how. Such knowledge was earned painfully. Many have chosen to ignore my warnings, but I beg that you are not among them.

    <p><em>I am the Harbinger, and Doom is coming.</em></p>

    <h2>bonds</h2>
    <p>You start with 2 bonds with the other members of the Fellowship. Use these, or make your own:</p>

    <h2>harbinger gear</h2>
    <p>You start with just enough food <i>(Food, 2 Uses)</i> and some wizardly baubles <i>(Useful, 2 Uses).</i> Every Harbinger&#39;s gear is unique, and no other will carry the same things you do.</p>

    </ul>

    <h2>harbinger&#39;s companions</h2>
    <p>Harbinger companions are those allies who are particularly likely to join arms with you. Many of them are available as Gear options - a Companion in your Gear will always return to you, heal, or be replaced by another when you <i>Recover</i>.</p>

    <h3>You have these three Agendas:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Be Brave, Take Risks</li>
        <li>Tell Us Of Your People</li>

    <h2>stats</h2>
    <p>Your <b>Wisdom </b>stat is +2. Assign +2, +1, +0, -1 to your other stats.</p>
    <p><b>When a stat is damaged,</b> mark the small box. You are in <b>Despair</b> when you roll a damaged stat.</p>

    <h2>what is the heir?</h2>
    <p><strong>Choose the option that best represents your people.</strong></p>
    <h3>the great builders</h3>
    <p>Your kingdom is famous for their advanced technology, and you bring that power with you. <b>When you analyze architecture or engineering, </b>you can always ask &quot;How do I fix this?&quot; or &quot;How do I break this?&quot;</p>
    <p>You also add Engineering Tools <i>(2 Uses, Useful) </i>to your Gear, which can produce nearly anything you might need to fix or break something you ask about.</p>
    <h3>the lost line of kings</h3>
    <p>Your kingdom has fallen and your family and fortunes are lost, but you remain. Some say you are cursed, others say you are lucky to be alive at all. <b>Once per scene, </b>you may re- roll one die, yours or another&#39;s. Tell us how your curse changed the outcome, after seeing the new result.</p>
    <h3>the stalwart defenders</h3>
    <p>Your kingdom is all that has stood between the Overlord and the rest of the world for centuries, locking them away. Stopping them now falls squarely on your shoulders.</p>
    <p><strong>When you <i>Overcome </i>the attacks of a Threat to the World,</strong> you never need to pay a price first.</p>
    <p><strong>When you <i>Overcome </i>an attack that would harm someone you have three Bonds with,</strong> you are filled with Hope.</p>
    <h3>the forgotten lands</h3>

    <h2>playing as the heir</h2>
    <p>The Heir is the leader, the ruler, the one everyone else looks up to. Their people are versatile, wise, and strong, and your position gives you a lot of power. The Heir gives you the ability to throw your name around, guarantee good treatment for the fellowship, and strike down those who would oppose you.</p>
    <p>Play as The Heir if you want to lead the fellowship, if you value versatility and consistency, if you want to be surrounded by powerful companions, or if you want to do your own thing with conviction.</p>

    <h2>heir&#39;s core</h2>
    <p><strong>The Heir has these moves.</strong></p>
    <h3>royal treatment</h3>
    <p><b>When you visit the ruler of a place and introduce yourself, </b>you and your friends are all given a room for the night and a hot meal to <i>Fill Your Belly</i>, free of charge.</p>
    <h3>yes, my liege</h3>
    <p><b>When you issue a command to someone below your rank,  </b>they&#39;ll do it immediately, no questions asked. Someone is below your rank if they are of your People, if they are a Companion, or if they serve or follow someone who has shown you <i>Royal Treatment</i>. You never need to <i>Talk Sense </i>to someone who is below your rank.</p>
    <p><strong>When you give a command that directly harms the person you gave the command to,  they become immune to this move forever.</strong></p>

    <h2>heir&#39;s custom</h2>
    <p><strong>Choose two of these moves to further define what it means to be the Heir.</strong></p>
    <h3>strike true</h3>
    <p><strong>When you could <i>Finish Them </i>in single combat,</strong> instead of rolling, you may strike a decisive blow.</p>
    <p><strong>Choose one, and tell us how you do it:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Beaten Down:</strong> They cannot cause further harm during this scene.</li>
        <li><strong>Pinned Down:</strong> They cannot give chase.</li>
        <li><strong>Taken Down:</strong> Choose one of their already damaged stats. Remove it - they no longer have that stat, nor any Threats associated with it.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>field treatment (wisdom)</h3>
    <p><strong>When you treat someone&#39;s wounds,</strong> roll +Wisdom.</p>
    <p><strong>On a 7+,</strong> they heal 1 damage.</p>
    <p><strong>On a 9-,</strong> it doesn&#39;t go smoothly. Either they damage another stat of their choice, or you need to pay a price.</p>
    <p>You can only use this Move on someone who has just been hurt. If they were hurt in a previous scene, it is too late for you to help.</p>
    <h3>foreign exchange</h3>
    <p>Take a Custom Move from any basic playbook.</p>
    <p>You may also take an Agenda from the chosen playbook.</p>
    <p><strong>This Move cannot be shared.</strong></p>
    <h3>how dare you</h3>
    <p><strong>When someone insults you to your face,</strong> you may choose to lash out or remain stoic.</p>
    <p><b>If you lash out, </b>roll to <i>Finish Them </i>with +Blood if you lash out with your weapon, or +Grace if you lash out with your tongue. <b>If you remain stoic, </b>ask two questions from the <i>Look Closely </i>list without rolling. Their outburst tells you everything.</p>
    <h3>long live the queen</h3>
    <p><strong>When someone else rolls to <i>Overcome </i>harm you would suffer,</strong> they are filled with Hope for their roll.</p>
    <p>You may always have Companions take harm for you if they are within arm&#39;s reach, even if you are not aware of the incoming harm.</p>
    <h3>noble bearing</h3>
    <p>Your allies are always where you need them most.</p>
    <p><strong>When you are in dire need,</strong> you may erase one of your Bonds to have the person listed in that bond appear at your side.</p>
    <p><strong>This Move cannot be shared.</strong></p>
    <h3>parry! counter! thrust!</h3>
    <p><strong>When you fight an enemy one on one in Melee range,</strong> you may <i>Keep Them Busy </i>as if you rolled a 10+.</p>
    <h3>quiet! don&#39;t move...</h3>
    <p><strong>When you duck aside and stay silent and still,</strong> enemies will never spot you unless you leave your position. You may hide your allies as well, so long as you hold up a hand, warning them to silence, and they do not speak.</p>

    <h2>heir&#39;s advancement</p>
    <h2>level</h2>
    <p><strong>When you Level Up, increase your level by 1, then choose an option from the list and mark it. You may only choose each option once.</strong> <em>You begin the game at level 1.</em></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Increase your Blood or Grace by 1 (to a maximum of +3).</li>

    <p><em>I am the Heir, and the burden of history is my blade.</em></p>

    <h2>bonds</h2>
    <p>You start with 4 bonds with the other members of the Fellowship. Use these, or make your own:</p>
    <p>I shall take <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </u> under my wing, and teach them all that I know.</p>
    <p><u> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </u> has proven a valuable companion.</p>
    <p><u> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </u> is a friend of the family.</p>
    <p>I am in love with <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </u> .</p>
    <p>I once betrayed <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </u> , and I am desperate for forgiveness.</p>
    <p><u> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </u> &#39;s people have aided mine throughout history.</p>
    <p>I prefer to work with <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </u> when I can.</p>
    <p>I have never had a more loyal ally than <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </u> .</p>
    <p>I would give my life for <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </u> .</p>
    <p><u> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </u> would give their life for me.</p>
    <p><strong>Record your other bonds here:</strong></p>

    <h2>royal gear</h2>
    <p>You start with some food <i>(Food, 3 Uses),</i> poultices <i>(Healing, Slow, 2 Uses),</i> a warhorse you have 1 Bond with, a beautiful blade with a long and storied past <i>(Melee, Precious), </i>and a mansion or castle to call home.</p>
    <p>You also carry a symbol of royalty, which will grant you an audience with anyone you show it to. This symbol is irreplaceable - do not lose it.</p>
    <p>You also gain the Fellowship of the community you call home. Choose one Fellowship move from Chapter 4 to start the game with.</p>
    <h3>Choose your protection:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>A second sword, and Regal armor <em>(Armor, 1 Use)</em></li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Choose the one thing you brought excessive amounts of:</h3>

        <li>Loads of cash <em>(Precious, 2 Uses)</em></li>
        <li>Fine food <i>(Food, 3 Uses) </i>and drink <i>(Healing, Drunk, 2 Uses)</i></li>

    <h2>heir&#39;s companions</h2>

    </ul>

    <h2>agenda</h2>
    <p><strong>When you know not what to do, consult your Agendas.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>You have these three Agendas:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Be Brave, Take Risks</li>
        <li>Tell Us Of Your People</li>
        <li>Improve The World Around You</li>

    <h3>Capitalism Ho!</h3>
    <p>Seek a profit, no matter the cost.</p>
    <h3>Destroy Something Beautiful</h3>
    <p>Bring an end to beautiful or valuable things.</p>

    <h2>stats</h2>
    <p>Your <b>Blood </b>stat is +2. Assign +2, +1, +0, -1 to your other stats.</p>

    </ul>
    
    <h2>what is an orc?</h2>
    <p>Choose the option that best represents your people:</p>
    <h3>children of fire</h3>
    <p>Your people are forged in flame, and have more in common with coal and ash than flesh and bone.</p>
    <p>You never take damage from fire and heat, and you have the Burning tag.</p>
    <h3>daughters of chaos</h3>
    <p>Your people are born free, determined to follow their hearts and choose their own destinies.</p>
    <p><b>When someone attempts to enslave, control, intimidate, terrify, or command you, </b>you can always act as you please. The Overlord cannot use the moves <i>Twist the Knife</i>, <i>Fear Me</i>, or <i>An Offer You Can&#39;t Refuse </i>on you, and your people are immune to the Heir&#39;s Core move <i>Yes, My Liege</i>.</p>
    <h3>spawn of darkness</h3>
    <p>Your people are fungal in nature, well suited to the darkness and damp. You can see perfectly in the dark, and your body is quite unlike those of flesh and blood. The Drunk tag never applies to you, and you are immune to poisons and diseases that would harm anyone else.</p>
    <h3>sons of war</h3>
    <p>You were born and raised for battle, and war is all your people know. Everything is a weapon, in your eyes.</p>
    <p><b>As long as there is something within arm&#39;s reach that you can break, </b>you can use <i>Fires of Industry </i>to instantly create new weapons in the heat of battle.</p>

    <h2>playing as the orc</h2>
    <p>The Orc is a fighter. Their people are never content with leaving things as they are, and progress is the most important aspect of Orc society. The Orc is all about war, and has the tools to fight, win, and thrive.</p>
    <p>Play as The Orc if you want to be able to destroy anything you see, if you enjoy creativity and spontaneous decision making, if you want to lash out at a world that has wronged and judged you, or if you just want to be a big green murder machine.</p>


    <h2>orcish core</h2>
    <p><strong>All Orcs have these moves.</strong></p>
    <h3>the fires of industry</h3>
    <p><strong>As long as you have a minute&#39;s time and destroy something in the process,</strong> you can craft an Orc-Made weapon of your own design. Orc-Made weapons are Clumsy in any hands but an Orc&#39;s, and they are ugly to all but Orcs. The weapon is Melee.</p>
    <p>Weapons you make are not added to your Gear - they are temporary and must be replaced when they are lost or damaged. You cannot carry more than 4 weapons you&#39;ve made at a single time, but you can restock weaponry between scenes as you like.</p>
    <p><strong>When you Share this move with another,</strong> they gain an appreciation for the utility or simplicity of Orc-Made weaponry. Orc-Made weapons are not Clumsy in the hands of those with this move.</p>
    <h3>dishonor before death</h3>
    <p><b>When you try to kill someone in glorious combat, </b>you can break your weapon to roll to <i>Finish Them</i>, even if you do not have an advantage.</p>
    <p><strong>When you must pay a price,  you may always choose to break your weapon.</strong></p>

    <h2>orc custom</h2>
    <p><strong>Choose two of these moves to further define what it means to be the Orc.</strong></p>
    <h3>shaman</h3>
    <p><strong>When you draw upon the hidden power of the orcs,</strong> choose a spell from below, then mark it. You cannot use a spell while it is marked.</p>
    <p><strong>When you <i>Fill Your Belly</i>,</strong> you may use one extra Food to remove a mark from one spell. When you <i>Recover</i>, remove all marks on your spells.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Séance: </strong>Ask a single question about anything, and immediately receive two answers - one is true, one is false, and you know not which is which.</li>
        <li><strong>Smell Danger: </strong>Use this when you become ambushed or surprised to react just before that happens.</li>
        <li><strong>Bound By Blood: </strong>Leave a bloody sign upon someone&#39;s skin. You can remove that sign at any time to leap out of the bloody sign, instantly appearing at their side from anywhere you may have been.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>This move cannot be Shared.</strong></p>
    <h3>bloodhound (blood)</h3>
    <p><strong>When you track someone whose trail isn&#39;t cold,</strong> roll +Blood. <b>On a 10+, </b>choose both.</p>
    <p><strong>On a 7-9,</strong> choose one: Either you find them quickly, or they do not know they were followed.</p>
    <h3>brutally cunning</h3>
    <p><strong>When you strike an enemy from ambush,</strong> you may kill them. This does not work against a <b>Threat to the World.</b></p>
    <h3>half-orc</h3>
    <p>Take a Custom Move from any basic playbook.</p>
    <p>You may also take an Agenda from the chosen playbook.</p>
    <p><strong>This Move cannot be shared.</strong></p>
    <h3>i smell fear</h3>
    <p><b>When you <em>Look Closely</em> at a person, so closely it makes them upset, uncomfortable, or scared,</b> you may ask questions from both the Speak Softly and the Look Closely lists, and you can ask one more question than your roll would normally allow.</p>
    <h3>iron stomach</h3>
    <p>You can eat things no one else would ever try to.</p>
    <p><strong>When you <i>Fill Your Belly,</i></strong> you may spend Uses from anything as if they had the Food tag instead of their actual tags.</p>
    <h3>self-orctualized</h3>
    <p>Choose two options from the final list of Orcish Gear <em>(strong as an ox, tough as nails, scary as hell, or cunning as can be).</em> Both of those options are added to your Gear permanently. You cannot choose an option you already have.</p>
    <h3>the sweat of your brow</h3>
    <p><strong>When you create a weapon for yourself,</strong> you may choose an enhancement for the weapon from this list:
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Destructive:</strong> This weapon is Dangerous, great for causing massive and uncontrollable damage.</li>
        <li><strong>Foe-Smelling:</strong> This weapon burns to the touch when in the presence of those who mean you harm. To you, this heat is only a warning, but it will harm others who try to touch it.</li>
        <li><strong>Spiked:</strong> This weapon is Piercing, and Armor cannot be used against it.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>orcish advancement</h2>
    <h3>level</h3>
    <p><strong>When you Level Up, increase your level by 1, then choose an option from the list and mark it. You may only choose each option once.</strong> <em>You begin the game at level 1.</em></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Increase your Courage or Sense by 1 (to a max of +3).</li>
        <li>Increase one of your stats by 1 (to a maximum of +3).</li>
        <li>Take another Orc Custom.</li>
        <li>Take another Orc Custom.</li>
        <li>Choose a single option from up to two other players&#39; Gear lists. Your choices are added to your Gear permanently.</li>
        <li>Share one of your Moves with another player.</li>
        <li><strong>You have Changed.</strong> You must be level 5 or higher to take this Advancement. <b>When you Change,</b> choose a Destiny you meet the requirements for and take its first Move.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>I have earned my place in this world. It was earned with sweat of the brow and cunning of the hand. Progress, industry, and toughness are what my people are known for, and they are the qualities that made me their champion. The world will change in our wake, whether poets and scholars and cowards like it or not.</em></p>
    <p><em>Not for us is the shallow &quot;beauty&quot; of timeless stagnation. I will smash that which holds us back and destroy those who would dominate us. Nothing will stand in my way and remain unbroken. You have my word on that, if you will have my blade.</em></p>
    <p><em>For I am the Orc, and my people will always move forward.</em></p>

    <h2>bonds</h2>
    <p>You start with 4 bonds with the other members of the Fellowship. Use these, or make your own:</p>
    <p><u> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </u> seeks power like mine, but is not yet ready.</p>
    <p> <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </u> and I are bound by blood, shared or otherwise.</em></p>
    <p>I have destroyed something that <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </u> loved, and I seek their forgiveness.</p>
    <p><u> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </u> is my party buddy.</p>
    <p><u> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </u> and I used to fight all the time but we can&#39;t remember why.</p>
    <p>I will use my strength to keep <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </u> safe.</p>
    <p>I&#39;d know the smell of <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </u> anywhere.</p>
    <p>I cannot help but respect <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </u> .</p>
    <p>I would give my life for <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </u> without a thought.</p>

    </ul>
    
    <h2>orcish companions</h2>

    <p><strong>Choose your purpose:</strong></p>
    <h3>keep them safe</h3>
    <p>You are here to make sure they come back home after this is all over, no matter what. <b>When you are with someone you have a Bond with and they take harm, </b>you may take that harm in their place.</p>

    <p>Play as The Squire if you want to be the unlikely hero, the underdog who was given a chance, if you like playing the support character who smoothes out problems, or if you&#39;re the quiet type who is fine hanging back and letting the real heroes do most of the work.</p>

    <p>You can have an unlimited number of Bonds with anybody. <b>People who you have Bonds with do not become Companions. </b>You do not have enough pull with the fellowship to just recruit people. Those you have Bonds with will think well of you and will try not to harm you if they can help it, regardless of their feelings for the rest of the fellowship.</p>
    <p>You can <i>Command Lore </i>about anyone you have any Bonds with, except for your Bonds with other players. You can <i>Command Lore </i>about Companions, friends, and minions of the Overlord who you have Bonds with, but you cannot <i>Command Lore </i>about the other heroes of the fellowship or about the Overlord.</p>
    <p><strong>This move cannot be Shared.</strong></p>
    <h3>please, just listen</h3>
    <p><strong>When you <i>Talk Sense </i>to someone,</strong> you may erase a Bond with them instead of owing them a favor.</p>
    <p><strong>When you <i>Speak Softly </i>with someone,</strong> you may erase a Bond with them to make them answer a question they refuse to answer.</p>
    <h3>it&#39;s dangerous to go alone</h3>
    <p><b>When you watch someone&#39;s back and keep your eyes peeled, </b>you can roll to <i>Overcome </i>any harm against them with +Sense instead of +Blood.</p>

    <h2>your people</h2>
    <p>You... are different. You&#39;re a nobody. You&#39;re no champion, you&#39;re no hero. But somehow, you&#39;re here, and somehow, you are. You do not Command Lore like the others do. You have no people to call your own, no hold in this world.</p>
    <p>But you can make friends. People like you. People trust you. And friendship is the strongest power of all. Your People aren&#39;t a culture or a society. Your People are the friends you make along the way.</p>
    
    <h2>squire custom</h2>
    <p><strong>Choose two of these moves to further define what it means to be the Squire.</strong></p>
    <h3>eager apprentice</h3>
    <p><strong>When someone you have a Bond with talks you through it,</strong> you can use one of their moves. If they are another player, you can only use a move that they could Share with you. If they are a Companion or an enemy, you must damage one of your stats to use one of their moves. You may only borrow one Move per scene.</p>
    <h3>i&#39;ve got a bad feeling about this</h3>
    <p><strong>When you&#39;re certain something&#39;s wrong here,</strong> you may ask the Overlord to tell you the safest way out, and also the quickest way out. They will answer truthfully.</p>
    <h3>i won&#39;t let you down!</h3>
    <p><strong>When you <i>Keep Them Busy </i>and get a 7-9,</strong> you may erase a Bond to take the 10+ result instead. The Bond must either be with someone you are protecting, or with someone who is helping you to <i>Keep Them Busy</i>.</p>
    <h3>power of friendship</h3>
    <p>Your Bonds have the tags Precious and Useful, and you can Use them by erasing them.</p>
    <p><strong>This move cannot be Shared.</strong></p>
    <h3>run for it!</h3>
    <p><strong>When you <i>Get Away </i>by running right past or right through the danger,</strong> roll +Courage instead of +Grace. Any allies who run after you may also roll +Courage instead of +Grace to <i>Get Away</i>.</p>
    <h3>teach me your ways</h3>
    <p>Choose a Move another player knows. That Move must be one they can share. They share that Move with you.</p>
    <p><strong>This move cannot be Shared.</strong></p>
    <h3>voice of reason</h3>
    <p>You alone are the voice of reason in this insane world. <strong>When you offer advice to another player and they ignore it,</strong> you are filled with Hope during any attempts to bail them out of whatever mess they got themselves into. Basically, if you could say &quot;I told you so&quot; after your action, you have Hope to do it.</p>
    <h3>we&#39;ll make it</h3>
    <p>Your Bonds have the Healing tag, and you can Use them by erasing them. Your Bonds can only be used to heal the person listed in them, and only while you are by their side.</p>
    <p><strong>This move cannot be Shared.</strong></p>

    <h2>squire&#39;s advancement</h2>
    <h3>level</h3>
    <p><strong>When you Level Up, increase your level by 1, then choose an option from the list and mark it. You may only choose each option once.</strong><em>You begin the game at level 1.</em></p>

        <li>Choose a different player. They share a Move with you.</li>
        <li><strong>You have Changed.</strong> You must be level 5 or higher to take this Advancement. <b>When you Change,</b> choose a Destiny you meet the requirements for and take its first Move.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>I&#39;m not as much concerned with all these grand sorts of things. I mean, they concern themselves with me often enough - that&#39;s what I get for stickin&#39; my neck out - but I&#39;m not gonna&#39; go out of my way for any glory or fame or nothin&#39;. I&#39;m here because, well, it sounds like you need all the help you can get. Even if that help&#39;s just me.</em></p>
    <p><em>I&#39;m pretty handy, I suppose, and I know a lot of little tricks to make things easier. I&#39;ll keep us on track, no problem. We&#39;ll make it to the end of that road, and the return trip, to boot. I&#39;ll make sure of it, crossy my heart.</em></p>
    <p><em>Oh, do you need a hand with that? I&#39;m the Squire, let me take</em></p>

    <h2>bonds</h2>
    <p>You start with 4 bonds with the other members of the Fellowship. Use these, or make your own:</p>
    <p>I have <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </u> &#39;s back, no matter what.</p>
    <p><u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </u> looks out for me.</p>
    <p>I know I can trust <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </u> no matter what.</p>
    <p>I&#39;ve never even seen someone like <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </u> before.</p>
    <p><u> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </u> is always willing to listen to me, even when no one else has time.</p>
    <p>I&#39;ve bailed <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </u> out of trouble more times than I can count.</p>
    <p>I don&#39;t know why but <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </u> really trusts me.</p>
    <p>I&#39;d do anything for <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </u> .</p>
    <p><u> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </u> and I have shared a moment of peace together.</p>
    <p>I am afraid of losing <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </u> .</p>
    <p>I think <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </u> likes me romanically, but its hard to believe.</p>
    <p>I try so hard to live up to <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </u> &#39;s expectations.</p>
    <p><strong>Record your other bonds here:</strong></p>
