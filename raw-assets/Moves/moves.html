<p><i>Fellowship</i> is a game about the journey. Several heroes will travel the world together, seeing a variety of interesting places on their journey to stop a great evil from destroying the land. There will be many threats and trials on their path.</p>
<p>Each trial they face is a single <b>scene</b>, and every scene has a flow to it. <i>Fellowship </i>is all about playing out those little scenes, stringing them together to create your adventure.</p>
<p>Those scenes are strung together into <b>stories</b>, collections of scenes that share a central goal. Different kinds of stories have different means of setting scenes and progression.</p>
<p><em>This playbook contains the basic rules for playing as the fellowship. You should have one copy of this playbook on hand for every two or three people playing the game.</em></p>

<h3>BASIC RULES</h3>

<h2>the flow of play</h2>
<p>The flow of play for each scene goes like this:</p>
<ol>
    <li><b>Set the Scene, Set the Stakes:</b> The Overlord will set the scene, telling everyone what is here and what is going on. The heroes will decide what they want to do next. Once you know what&#39;s here and what you&#39;re doing, the scene is set, and it&#39;s time to set the stakes.</p>
        <p>There will almost always be something in the fellowship&#39;s way, a problem they must overcome. What&#39;s on the line here? What could go wrong? You don&#39;t need to discuss this step by step, but each player should have the stakes in mind as they proceed with the scene.</li>
    <li><b>Swing the Spotlight: </b>Once the stakes are set, it is time to take action, and the Spotlight swings around the table. The Spotlight is the turn order of <i>Fellowship, </i>but this turn order is not rigid or fixed. The Spotlight is flexible, and it goes where it needs to go, as follows:</p>
        <p><b>When someone is in Danger,</b> they get the Spotlight to tell us how they deal with that.</p>
        <p><b>When someone hasn&#39;t done something in a while,</b> they get the Spotlight to tell us what they were up to.</p>
        <p><b>When someone has an idea, leaps into action, speaks for the group, or does something noteworthy,</b> they get the Spotlight to do their thing.</p>
        <p><b>When someone&#39;s own actions put them directly into danger, </b>they <i>lose </i>the Spotlight, leaving their moment on a cliffhanger.</p>
        <p><b>When a player has the Spotlight,</b> they will describe what they are doing, and the Overlord will describe how the world reacts to their actions, and may require them to make a Move. The Spotlight is a dialogue, going back and forth until something has happened.</p>
        <p><b>When their moment has been long enough,</b> or <b>when the danger shifts elsewhere,</b> or <b>when another player has something to do,</b> or <b>when it would be a good cliffhanger,</b> swing the Spotlight.</p>
        <p>Don&#39;t let anyone keep the Spotlight for too long. Share the Spotlight often, and share the Spotlight with everyone. Most of the game will be played while the Spotlight is swinging, so manage the Spotlight well.</li>
    <li><b>Quick Recap:</b> Once a scene is done, tell us what happened, briefly, and check in on everyone. It can be hard to track everything while the Spotlight is swinging. Take a quick recap to catch up on what happened during the scene before moving on to the next.</li>
</ol>

<h2>fellowship principles</h2>
<p>Your <b>Principles</b> are the rules you must follow.</p>
<p><b>Do not break them.</b></p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Be Heroic.</b></p>
        <p>You&#39;re here to save the day. You have a duty to save this world, and you cannot go back on that. Act like the heroes you are.</li>
    <li><b>Create solutions, not problems.</b></p>
        <p>You&#39;re the good guys. There&#39;s plenty of bad going around already - do not make the world worse.</li>
    <li><b>Address the characters, not the players.</b></p>
        <p>Don&#39;t call them &quot;Jesse&quot; or &quot;Sam,&quot; call them &quot;Aurora&quot; and &quot;Rumblebelly.&quot;</li>
    <li><b>Embrace the fantastic.</b></p>
        <p>Don&#39;t let the world be boring. Do fun things, make the world weird, commit to acting and being fantastic.</li>
    <li><b>Make a move that follows.</b></p>
        <p>You can only make a move you meet the trigger for, and the results of your move will tell us how the story plays out. You cannot make a move if you don&#39;t fulfill the trigger.
        </li>
    <li><b>Remind us of your moves.</b></p>
        <p>Everyone shares the same basic moves, but everyone has their own moves to call upon when they need them. Be clear which move you are using when you trigger it, and let us know exactly what happens as a result.</li>
    <li><b>Always ask questions. Always answer questions.</b></p>
        <p>If you don&#39;t know, ask. If someone asks you, answer.</li>
    <li><b>Begin and end with the fiction.</b></p>
        <p>Start a move with what triggered it, end the move with what it accomplished, and then move to the next move from there.</li>
    <li><b>Don&#39;t steal the spotlight...</b></p>
        <p>When another player is taking action, let them do so. Don&#39;t interrupt, don&#39;t take over, don&#39;t get in their way. If they don&#39;t know what to do, you can give them some suggestions, but your hero shouldn&#39;t jump in and take their moment from them. It&#39;s their turn, not yours.</li>
    <li><b>...But shine on when you have it.</b></p>
        <p>When you have the spotlight, use it. Do something cool. Do something fun. Do something wild. It doesn&#39;t matter, so long as you <i>do something.</i></li>
</ul>

<h2>telling stories</h2>
<p>Scenes are combined together to tell overarching Stories. The 4 kinds of Stories you will tell in Fellowship are:</p>
<h3>a little downtime</h3>
<p>Downtime is what it sounds like. When the fellowship spends some time in civilization (usually when they Recover), they tell everyone how they pass their time.</p>
<p>Each player sets a single scene describing their downtime. The Overlord will follow up with a single question about it, such as &quot;who was there with you?&quot; or &quot;what made that harder than you expected?&quot; or &quot;someone in town didn&#39;t like that very much, who was it?&quot; Answer it.</p>
<p>Once everyone in the fellowship has set one scene, the Overlord sets a scene. They may either advance their plans or threaten the players while they thought they were safe.</p>
<p>Then, everyone decides whether to continue their downtime and set another scene, or end it. Downtime ends when at least half the fellowship is ready to move on.</p>

<h3>a long journey</h3>
<p>A Journey is the story of point A to point B. During a Journey, each player tells us one event that happened along the way, starting with whoever you like. The Overlord may frame the event by asking the player a question first, like &quot;what did you find off the beaten path?&quot; or &quot;what was really dangerous about this leg of the journey?&quot; or &quot;who did you meet on the read?&quot;</p>
<p>After someone describes the event, they choose another player at the table, and they tell us how they handled the event. Give each event as much or as little detail as it needs.</p>
<p>The Overlord also sets a scene during this journey, telling the fellowship how their minions made the journey harder.</p>
<p><b>After every event has been resolved,</b> you make it to your destination.</p>

<h3>a proper challenge</h3>
<p>Challenges are the story of earning something worthwhile. When the fellowship sets a short term goal, the story to achieve it is the Challenge. Everyone works together in every scene, and new scenes are set until the Challenge is overcome or the goal is unattainable.</p>
<p>A Challenge usually comes from trying to earn Fellowship. When you come to a community, they will have some trouble, usually caused by the Overlord, that they need help with, and your Challenge is resolving their troubles.</p>
<p>The first scene of a challenge is always spent making a plan. The fellowship decides what they need to do to get their goal, and the next scene will be either the first step of the plan in action, or gathering what you need to set the plan in motion. Each scene after that will flow from there.</p>

<h3>the showdown</p>
<p>It doesn&#39;t matter what you were doing: the Overlord, one of their Generals, or a Source of Power has appeared, and now you need to deal with it.</p>
<p>The Showdown always begins with the new threat asserting itself. They make a show of power, causing chaos or fear or fire or explosions. Whatever they do, it is dangerous.</p>
<p>Once the show of force is over, the fellowship is placed in danger and must take action immediately. The Showdown is less of a string of scenes, and more an extended, dangerous, high stakes scene, that will not end until either the threat or the fellowship are defeated or forced to retreat.</p>

<h2>quick start</h2>
<p>First time playing<i>Fellowship? </i>Follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
    <li><b>Pick Your Playbook</b> You can&#39;t pick a playbook someone else has, and one player must be the Overlord.</li>
    <li><b>Choose your Name, Look, and Agenda</b></li>
    <li><b>Assign your Stats</b></li>
    <li><b>Choose your Moves</b></li>
    <li><b>Choose your Gear</b> These steps are all on your playbook. Look it over and choose from the options your playbook gives you.</li>
    <li><b>Introduce your Hero</b> Tell us about your hero, tell us why you are your people&#39;s champion, and then tell us three facts about your people. Each player must do this.</li>
    <li><b>Group Questions</b> Everyone answer these together: Whose people did the Overlord hit first and hardest? Whose people has the Overlord mostly ignored? What impossible thing has the Overlord already done?</li>
    <li><b>Bonds</b> Each player writes their name in one of the Overlord&#39;s Bonds, then each player fills in however many Bonds their playbook says they start with with the names of anyone they know - each other, Companions, even the Overlord.</li>
    <li><b>Rumors</b> Each player answers this prompt individually: Choose another player, and tell us a rumor or superstition your people hold about their people. They cannot tell you whether or not it is true.</li>
    <li><b>Start playing!</b></li>
</ol>

<h2>tags</h2>
<h3>range tags</h3>
<p>Range tags tell you where you need to be to use a weapon or attack successfully.</p>

<p><b>Ranged:</b> You can hit them if you can see them. Ranged weapons usually need Ammo or require Reloading.</p>
<p><b>Area:</b> Area attacks hit everyone in a group.</p>
<p><b>Dangerous:</b> Dangerous attacks are like Area attacks, but they always cause collateral damage.</p>
<h3>item tags</h3>
<p>Item tags can go on anything, and describe the properties that a thing has.</p>

<p><b>Slow:</b> This takes time and safety to use properly.</p>
<p><b>Thrown:</b> If you use this weapon as a Ranged weapon, you lose it until you can go and get it back. </p>

<h3>limited tags</h3>
<p>Some items have a set number of Uses. These tags cost a</p>
<p>Use to gain their benefits.</p>
<p><b>Ammo:</b> Spend 1 Use to make a move with this weapon. It does not cost Ammo unless the move tells you it does.</p>

<p><b>Precious:</b> Spend 1 Use to Forge a Bond with someone, or to not have to do a favor for someone. </p>
<p><b>Useful:</b> Spend 1 Use to produce something helpful.</p>
<p><b>Vigor:</b> When you Use this, you have Hope and cannot have Despair for your next roll.</p>
<p><b>Trap:</b> Traps are items you need to place in advance.</p>

<p><em>Fellowship</em> is a game about the challenge. A lot of different challenges will get in your way throughout your journey, and you will need to stand up and face those challenges if you want to succeed. When the result of your actions is unclear, your Moves will resolve them.</p>
<p>Each move has a <b>Trigger</b>. If you do not meet the trigger, the move doesn&#39;t happen. The trigger is the part in bold that begins with &quot;When you...&quot; at the start of each move. To perform a move, you must fulfill the trigger.</p>
<p>Most moves have a <b>Check</b>. The Check is what you must do to perform the move, usually rolling dice and adding a number. If the check says something like &quot;roll +Blood&quot;, then you roll two six sided dice and add your Blood stat to the roll.</p>
<p>Every move has a <b>Result</b>. The result is what happens if you meet both the trigger and the check. On moves with a roll, the result will change depending on the numbers you rolled, with higher numbers being better. 7+ means &quot;7 or higher,&quot; 9- means &quot;9 or less,&quot; and a range like &quot;7-9&quot; means &quot;7, 8, or 9&quot;.</p>
<p>Once you have hit the trigger, paid for the check, and figured out the result, the move is over, and you figure out what your move did and what happens next from there.</p>

<h3>BASIC RULES</h3>

<h2>basic moves</h2>
<h3>finish them</h3>
<p><b>any stat</b></p>
<p><b>When you attempt to defeat an enemy you hold an advantage over,</b> tell us what you want to do to them and roll the appropriate stat.</p>
<p><b>If you do not have an advantage over them, </b>you cannot attempt to <i>Finish Them</i>. An Advantage is something you need to get the upper hand, such as teamwork, theelement of surprise, or a moment&#39;s hesitation.</p>
<p><b>If you <em>Finish Them </em>by...</b></p>
<p><b>...trying to kill them,</b> roll +Blood. <b>On a 10+,</b> they die by your hand.</p>
<p><b>...forcing them to retreat,</b> roll +Courage. <b>On a 10+,</b> they back off. They won&#39;t be back anytime soon.</p>
<p><b>...outsmarting, terrifying, or overwhelming them,</b> roll +Grace. <b><b>On a 10+,</b> </b>they admit defeat, and will not willingly challenge you again.</p>
<p><b>...disabling them or knocking them out,</b> roll +Sense. <b>On a 10+,</b> they are physically incapacitated and unable to continue.</p>
<p><b>...showing them the error of their ways,</b> roll +Wisdom. <b>On a 10+,</b> you <i>Forge a Bond </i>with them, and they cannot bring themselves to hurt you.</p>
<p><b>On a 7-9,</b> you deal damage to them and lose your advantage over them. <b>If an ally was <em>Keeping Them Busy</em></b>, they aren't anymore</p>
<p><b>On a 6-,</b> you lose the advantage, and must face retaliation.</p>
<p><b>If you <em>Finish Them </em></p>using a weapon with Ammo,</b> use 1 Ammo. <b>If you have no Ammo,</b> you cannot <i>Finish Them </i>with that weapon.</p>
<p><b>If you have the Clumsy tag, </b>you take -1 to <i>Finish Them</i>.</p>

<h2><em>What is an Advantage?</em></h2>
<p>An <b>Advantage </b>is any means of fictional superiority you hold over someone else. <b>When you do something that sounds like an advantage, </b>then you have an advantage. <b>If they are better than you, </b>you do not have an advantage, and you will need to turn the tables in some way if you want to <i>Finish Them.</i></p>

<h3>overcome</h3>
<p><b>blood</b></p>
<p><b>When you attempt to avoid, redirect, or prevent the harm something will cause, </b>roll +Blood. You can <i>Overcome </i>any obstacle, threat, Cut, or Move made against you or an ally, if you are in position to act and have the means to stop it.</p>
<p><b>On a 10+,</b> you stop the obstacle, threat, Cut, or Move from causing harm.</p>
<p><b>On a 7-9,</b> choose one: Pay a price to take the 10+ result, or create a temporary solution. A temporary solution will delay the threat, but when time is up, it&#39;ll be back in force - the Overlord will tell you when.</p>
<p><em>Overcoming</em> harm with a weapon does not cost Ammo.</p>

<h3>keep them busy</h3>
<p><b>courage</b></p>
<p>When you act as a distraction or buy some time, tell us how and roll +Courage.</p>
<p><b>On a 7+, </b>you buy some time, and their attention is all on you, for now.</p>
<p><b>On a 9-,</b> they will retaliate against you when time is up.</p>
<p>If you <p><em>Keep Them Busy </em></p>using a weapon with Ammo, use 1 Ammo. If you have no Ammo, you cannot <i>Keep Them Busy </i>with that weapon. If you have the Clumsy tag, you take -1 to <i>Keep Them Busy.</i></p>

<h3>get away grace</h3>
<p>When you need to get somewhere out of reach or out of sight, tell us where you&#39;re going and roll +Grace.</h3>
<p><b>On a 10+,</b> choose two. <b>On a 7-9,</b> choose one:</p>
<ul>
    <li>You get there quickly, avoiding any harm along the way.</li>
    <li>You get there quietly, drawing no attention.</li>
    <li>You grab someone nearby and bring them with you.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>If you have the Clumsy tag, </b>you take -1 to <i>Get Away</i>.</p>
        
<h3>talk sense</h3>
<p><b>grace / sense / wisdom</b></p>
<p><b>When you speak with conviction and ask someone for help,</b> tell us what you want from them and why they should help you. <b>If they&#39;re willing to listen,</b> roll. <b>When you...</b></p>
<p><b>...detail your plan and their place in it,</b> roll +Sense.</p>
<p><b>...appeal to their emotions or desires,</b> roll +Wisdom.</p>
<p><b>...impress, dazzle, or trick them,</b> roll +Grace.</p>
<p><b>On a 7+,</b> they do as you ask, to the best of their ability.</p>
<p><b>On a 9-,</b> you owe them a favor. The more you ask of them, the more they&#39;ll ask of you, and they can cash in at any time - even right now, before they do as you ask.</p>
<p><b>On a 6-,</b> they choose one: They cannot do as you ask and will tell you why, or the favor you must do them is expensive, difficult, or demeaning.</p>

<h3>look closely</h3>
<p><b>sense</b></p>
<p><b>When you closely examine a situation or a location,</b> roll +Sense.</p>
<p><b>On a 7+,</b> ask three questions from the list.</p>
<p><b>On a 9-,</b> you find one of those answers the hard way.</p>
<p><b>On a 6-,</b> you may only ask one question.</p>
<p>Anyone can answer, but the Overlord has the final say.</p>
<ul>
    <li>What is going on here? What do my senses tell me?</li>
    <li>Is something hidden or out of place? If so, what looks suspicious?</li>
    <li>Tell me about <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </u> . How could it hurt me? How could it help me?</li>
    <li>Tell me about <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </u> . What are they doing? What will they do next?</li>
    <li>What will happen if I <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </u>?</li>
</ul>

<h3>speak softly</h3>
<p>wisdom</p>
<p>When you have a quiet chat with someone, you may roll +Wisdom. Then, ask three questions from the list.</p>
<p><b>On a 10+,</b> they must answer each question honestly.</p>
<p><b>On a 9-,</b> one of their answers is not helpful. Either they refuse to answer or they reveal a terrible truth you didn&#39;t want to hear, their choice.</p>
<p><b>On a 6-,</b> one of their other answers is false.</p>
<ul>
    <li>What can they tell us about <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </u> ?</li>
    <li>What were they doing, and what are they going to do next?</li>
    <li>What should I be wary of when dealing with them?</li>
    <li>What do they want, and how could we help them get it?</li>
    <li>What would they have us do next?</li>
</ul>

<h3>pay the price</h3>
<p><b>When a move tells you to pay a price,</b> tell us what it costs you. A price can be taking damage, losing or using equipment, suffering a setback, or losing an advantage. Whatever the cost, you must pay that price immediately before, during, or after the move you paid for.</p>

<h3>command lore</h3>
<p><b>When someone asks something about your character or your people,</b> tell them. <b>When you ask about another character or their people,</b> they will tell you. <b>When you ask about the Overlord,</b> they alone may choose not to answer.</p>

<h3>fill your belly</h3>
<p><b>When you are between scenes,</b> you may Use Food to heal one damage. <b>When you share a meal with friends,</b> one person may heal an extra point of damage.</p>

<h3>hope and despair</h3>
<p><b>When you have Hope and make a move,</b> roll three dice and keep the best two.</p>
<p><b>When you are in Despair and make a move,</b> roll three dice and keep the worst two.</p>
<p><b>When you have both,</b> they cancel out.</p>
<p><b>When someone outside the fellowship is in Despair,</b> they cannot do anything meaningful. <b>When you roll with a stat that has been Damaged,</b> you roll with Despair.</p>

<h3>damage</h3>
<p><b>When you take damage,</b> choose a stat and mark it. Sometimes you will not get a choice, and a stat will be damaged for you. <b>While a stat is damaged, </b>you are in Despair whenever you roll that stat. <b>When an enemy&#39;s stat or a Companion&#39;s stat is damaged, </b>they cannot use it.</p>
<p>You cannot mark a stat that has already been marked. <b>When you heal,</b> remove a mark from one of your stats.</p>
<p><b>When you take damage while all of your stats are already marked,</b> you get Taken Out.</p>

<h3>recover</h3>
<p><b>When the fellowship rests in a place of safety for over a week,</b> heal all of your stats and restock all of your Gear. The Overlord then advances their plans and heals one damage.</p>

<h3>taken out</h3>
<p>When all of your stats are damaged and you take further damage, you are Taken Out, and no longer able to help out for the rest of the scene. Tell us how you got Taken Out. What happened to you? What is going to happen to you next? Can the fellowship save you from your fate? If so, how? </p>

<h3>end of session</h3>
<p><b>When you reach the end of a session,</b> the fellowship answers these three questions:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Did we save or protect a community in need?</li>
    <li>Did we strike a blow against the Overlord and their minions?</li>
    <li>Did we learn more about the world and its peoples?</li>
</ul>
<p><b>For each &quot;yes&quot; answer,</b> the group chooses one. You may choose an option more than once. </p>
<ul>
    <li>Each fellowship player refreshes one piece of their Gear to its full value.</li>
    <li>Each fellowship player chooses one stat to heal. It doesn&#39;t have to be theirs.</li>
    <li>The fellowship and the Overlord each choose one player to Level Up. You cannot be chosen to Level Up if you are the highest level player or you have already been chosen to level up this session.</li>
</ul>

<h2>bond moves</h2>
<h3>forge a bond</h3>
<p><b>When you bond with someone over something you did or shared together,</b> record a new Bond with them on your sheet, describing the connection you two now hold. A Bond is a single sentence describing how you feel about them or what you two have done together. If you already had a Bond with them, you can add another Bond, or rewrite an existing one. You can never have more than three Bonds with someone.</p>
<p><b>If you <i>Forge a Bond</i> with someone outside the fellowship,</b> they will join your cause as a Companion, so long as the Bond holds.</p>

<h3>the bonds that bind us</h3>
<p><b>When two or more players who have Bonds with each other work together side by side,</b> they roll with Hope. <b>When one of them must pay a price,</b> another may choose to pay that price instead.</p>

<h3>the bonds that break us</h3>
<p><b>When your actions harm an ally,</b> immediately erase one of your Bonds with them. <b>When you have no Bonds with a member of the fellowship,</b> you cannot work alongside them without getting in each others&#39; way, and you both roll with Despair when working together.</p>

<h3>bound in service</h3>
<p><b>When you call upon a Companion for help,</b> you may damage one of their stats to create an advantage related to that stat. <b>If all of a Companion&#39;s stats are damaged and they&#39;d take further damage,</b> lose a Bond with them.</p>
<p><b>When no one has any Bonds with a Companion,</b> they leave the fellowship.</p>

<h3>heart of fire</h3>
<p><b>When you hold a Bond with the Overlord,</b> they do not become your Companion, but you still hold sway over them. You may erase that Bond with them at any time to buy yourself reprieve. <b>Choose one:</b> They will show you mercy, tell you something valuable, or ignore you for the time being.</p>

<h3>heart of iron</h3>
<p><b>When you would make a move against the Overlord, </b>you may automatically fail the roll to erase one of their Bonds with you. <b>If you do, </b>they steal the Spotlight and <i>Twist the Knife </i>against you, but they will not be able to react to anything the rest of the fellowship does while they hurt you.</p>
