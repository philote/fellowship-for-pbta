            <p><b>To become the Ascended,</b> you must take a Source of Power for yourself. This Destiny is only allowed in a game with the Overlord.</p>
            <p>The Ascended starts with either Inconceivable Truth or Infinite Power, your choice. You have also become a Threat to the World, and the Overlord always knows where you are.</p>
