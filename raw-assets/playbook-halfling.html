        <p><i>I have kept the good things secret and safe. We're small, often we'll go unnoticed, but any bully will pick on the weakest folks they can find. That's where I come in. I lead danger away, sling rocks at it, taunt it, trick it, you name it! If they won't pick on someone their own size, you can't expect me to play fair, can you?</i></p>
        <p><i>We like to duck out heads, enjoy our pleasures, and live our lives peacefully inside of our comfortable little nooks. Comfort, safety, security - they're what's important, you know? So that's what I stand for, if you'll have me.</i></p>
        <p><i>I am the Halfling, and my people are bigger than you think.</i></p>

            <h2>What is a halfling?</h2>
            <p><b>Choose the option that best represents your people:</b></p>
            <h4>clever storytellers</h4>
            <p>Your people love to collect stories from afar, and they love to share. You know just how to get someone to tell you what you want to hear.</p>
            <p>When you Speak Softly over stories and games, you may take the 7-9 result without rolling. If you also used Halfling Pipeleaf, take the 10+ result instead.</p>
            <p>When you Speak Softly and get a 6-, you may ask one less question. If you do, they do not get to refuse to answer one of your questions.</p>
            <h4>determined survivors</h4>
            <p>Your people have suffered many setbacks and tragedies, and they have never stopped you yet. You know exactly when to stand your ground and exactly when to bail.</p>
            <p>When you Get Away or Keep Them Busy and get a 6-, you may instead use the other Move as if you rolled a 7-9.</p>
            <h4>mischievous tricksters</h4>
            <p>Your people love surprises, and they are natural tricksters. The pranks they play are legendary.</p>
            <p>When you Sting Like A Bee, choose two options instead of one.</p>
            <h4>traveling nomads</h4>
            <p>Your people are travelers, never sticking in one place for long.</p>
            <p>When picking your Gear, choose one more option from each list - you came prepared for anything.</p>
            
            <h2>Playing as the halfling</h2>
            <p>The Halfling is a troublemaker. You are tiny, underestimated, the underdog, and relatively unknown. The Halfling is a tricksy sort. You'll pop up where they least expect you and you'll do much more than anyone else thinks you can.</p>
            <p>Play as The Halfling if you want to sneak around, if you want to play tricks on your enemies, if you like finding alternative solutions, or if your idea of a good time is partying and food.</p>
            
            <h2>Advancement</h2>
            <p><b>When you Level Up, increase your level by 1, then choose an option from the list and mark it. You may only choose each option once.</b></p>
            <p><i>You begin the game at level 1.</i></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Increase your Grace or Sense by 1 (to a maximum of +3). </li>
                <li>Increase one of your stats by 1 (to a maximum of +3).</li>
                <li>Take another Halfling Custom.</li>
                <li>Take another Halfling Custom, or choose another Move from the list of What Is A Halfling? options.</li>
                <li>Share one of your Moves or Gear options with another player.</li>
                <li>Choose a player you have 3 Bonds with. They share one of their Moves or Gear options with you.</li>
                <li>You have Changed. You must be level 5 or higher to take this Advancement. When you Change, choose a Destiny you meet the requirements for and take its first Move.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Bonds</h2>
            <p>You start with 4 bonds with the other members of the Fellowship. Use these, or make your own:</p>
            <p>_____________ really enjoys the finer things in life. </p>
            <p>I have mesmerized _____________ with my stories. </p>
            <p>_____________ respects me, and I respect them too!</p>
            <p>_____________ dragged me from my home and on the road to adventure!</p>
            <p>I once told a lie so good _____________ STILL thinks it's true.</p>
            <p>One of these days, I'll be as good at this adventuring business as _____________ is.</p>
            <p>I don't think _____________ has noticed how much I like them. </p>
            <p>_____________ has my back when things get tough out here. </p>
            <p>I've known _____________ for all my life!</p>
            <p>I will never lie to _____________ .</p>
