        <p><i>I have earned my place in this world. It was earned with sweat of the brow and cunning of the hand. Progress, industry, and toughness are what my people are known for, and they are the qualities that made me their champion. The world will change in our wake, whether poets and scholars and cowards like it or not.</i></p>
        <p><i>Not for us is the shallow "beauty" of timeless stagnation. I will smash that which holds us back and destroy those who would dominate us. Nothing will stand in my way and remain unbroken. You have my word on that, if you will have my blade.</i></p>
        <p><i>For I am the Orc, and my people will always move forward.</i></p>

            </ul>
            
            <h3>Agenda</h3>
            <p><b>When you know not what to do, consult your Agendas.</b></p>
            <p><b>You have these three Agendas:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Be Brave, Take Risks </li>
                <li>Tell Us Of Your People </li>

            <p>Assign +2, +1, +0, -1 to the others.</p>
            
            <h2>What is an orc?</h2>
            <p><b>Choose the option that best represents your people:</b></p>
            <h4>children of fire</h4>
            <p>Your people are forged in flame, and have more in common with coal and ash than flesh and bone.</p>
            <p>You never take damage from fire and heat, and you have the Burning tag.</p>
            <h4>daughters of chaos</h4>
            <p>Your people are born free, determined to follow their hearts and choose their own destinies.</p>
            <p>When someone attempts to enslave, control, intimidate, terrify, or command you, you can always act as you please. The Overlord cannot use the moves Twist the Knife, Fear Me, or An Offer You Can't Refuse on you, and your people are immune to the Heir's Core move Yes, My Liege.</p>
            <h4>spawn of darkness</h4>
            <p>Your people are fungal in nature, well suited to the darkness and damp. You can see perfectly in the dark, and your body is quite unlike those of flesh and blood. The Drunk tag never applies to you, and you are immune to poisons and diseases that would harm anyone else.</p>
            <h4>sons of war</h4>
            <p>You were born and raised for battle, and war is all your people know. Everything is a weapon, in your eyes.</p>
            <p>As long as there is something within arm's reach that you can break, you can use Fires of Industry to instantly create new weapons in the heat of battle.</p>
            
            <h2>Playing as the orc</h2>
            <p>The Orc is a fighter. Their people are never content with leaving things as they are, and progress is the most important aspect of Orc society. The Orc is all about war, and has the tools to fight, win, and thrive.</p>
            <p>Play as The Orc if you want to be able to destroy anything you see, if you enjoy creativity and spontaneous decision making, if you want to lash out at a world that has wronged and judged you, or if you just want to be a big green murder machine.</p>
            
            <h2>Advancement</h2>
            <p><b>When you Level Up, increase your level by 1, then choose an option from the list and mark it. You may only choose each option once.</b></p>
            <p><i>You begin the game at level 1.</i></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Increase your Courage or Sense by 1 (to a max of +3). </li>
                <li>Increase one of your stats by 1 (to a maximum of +3). </li>
                <li>Take another Orc Custom.</li>
                <li>Take another Orc Custom.</li>
                <li>Choose a single option from up to two other players' Gear lists. Your choices are added to your Gear permanently.</li>
                <li>Share one of your Moves with another player.</li>
                <li>You have Changed. You must be level 5 or higher to take this Advancement. When you Change, choose a Destiny you meet the requirements for and take its first Move.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Bonds</h2>
            <p>You start with 4 bonds with the other members of the Fellowship. Use these, or make your own:</p>
            <p>____________ seeks power pke mine, but is not yet ready. </p>
            <p>____________ and I are bound by blood, shared or otherwise.</p>
            <p>I have destroyed something that ____________ loved, and I seek their forgiveness.</p>

            </ul>

            <h2>Companions</h2>
