    <h1>ASCENDED</h1>
    <h2>DESTINY PLAYBOOK</h2>
    <p><em>You have become more than you once were, more than anyone should ever be. You have gained truly unparalleled power, but at what cost?</em></p>
    <h2>REQUIREMENTS</h2>
    <p><strong>To become the Ascended,</strong> you must take a Source of Power for yourself.</p>
    <p>This Destiny is only allowed in a game with the Overlord.</p>
    <p>The Ascended starts with either <i>Inconceivable Truth</i> or <i>Infinite Power</i>, your choice. You have also become a <b>Threat to the World</b>, and the Overlord always knows where you are.</p>
    <h3>INCONCEIVABLE TRUTH</h3>
    <p>You gain an <b>Overlord Stat</b>, write it now. See page 180 of the Fellowship book for more information.</p>
    <p>You can no longer <i>Command Lore </i>about your people - you have left them behind, and they are alien to you now.</p>
    <p><b>When an Overlord stat is damaged,</b> mark the box. Overlord stats are always true unless they are damaged.</p>
    <h3>INFINITE POWER</h3>
    <p>The power flows through your veins, more power than you ever imagined possible. <b>When you unleash the massive power contained within you, </b>you may take two damage to destroy anything that isn&#39;t a <b>Threat to the World</b>. Tell us what this means and what this looks like.</p>
    <p>This power comes with a cost. You lose the Agenda <b>Improve The World Around You</b>. Replace it with the Agenda <b>Show Off Your Power</b>, as you cannot be convinced there is anything greater than what you can accomplish now.</p>
    <h2>ADVANCEMENT</h2>
    <p><strong>When you <i>Level Up</i></strong>, choose one Advancement from either this list or from your Basic Playbook, then mark it. You may only choose each option once.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Take a Custom Move from any basic playbook. </li>
        <li>Take a Custom Move from any other Destiny. </li>
        <li>Take an Ascended Custom.</li>
        <li>Take an Ascended Custom.</li>
        <li>Take an Ascended Custom.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>CUSTOM MOVES</h2>
    <h3>INVINCIBLE SOUL</h3>
    <p><b>When you would get Taken Out,</b> heal 2 damage instead. This does not stop the Overlord from making you <i>An Offer You Can&#39;t Refuse</i>.</p>
    <p><b>When the Overlord makes you <i>An Offer You Can&#39;t Refuse</i>,</b> you will always accept their offer, but your power is great enough that you can negotiate. Add a caveat of your choosing to their terms.</p>
    <h3>UNPARALLELED SKILL</h3>
    <p><b>When you take damage in Melee combat,</b> you may immediately deal damage back to them. Ranged attacks cannot hit you - you will always dodge or deflect them, if it is remotely possible for you to do so.</p>
    <p>This Move doesn&#39;t work against a <b>Threat to the World.</b></p>
    <p>You can no longer work together with anyone else. <i>The Bonds That Bind Us</i> no longer bind you, and you cannot give or receive Hope.</p>
    <h3>UNSTOPPABLE FORCE</h3>
    <p>You never take the 6- result to <i>Overcome, Keep Them Busy</i>, or <i>Get Away</i>. <b>When you roll a 6- on those Moves,</b> act as though you rolled a 7.</p>
    <p>You can no longer compromise, retreat, or surrender, for any reason. <b>When you take a course of action,</b> you become completely committed to it.</p>
    <h3>UNTOUCHABLE BEAUTY</h3>
    <p>Nothing can leave its mark upon you, not anymore. You do not suffer the ravages of time, your wounds never scar, your form cannot be changed, and you cannot be touched or held by another (although you may hold or touch them).</p>
    <p>You no longer relate to those around you, and your Bonds weaken. You can never have more than one Bond with anyone. Erase your extra Bonds now.</p>

    <p>Choose two consequences for calling upon them for aid:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You and your people will owe an equal favor in return.</li>
        <li>They are slow to take action, and you will need to buy them time.</li>
        <li>They cannot travel, and you&#39;ll need to lure the threat to them.</li>

    <h3>ENDLESS DETERMINATION</h3>
    <p><b>When you get Taken Out,</b> heal your Courage stat. This does not stop the Overlord from making you <i>An Offer You Can&#39;t Refuse</i>.</p>
    <h3>FATE&#39;S PUPPET</h3>
    <p><b>When you act exactly as has been foretold in the Prophecy,</b> you can mark this Move to declare what happens next. What happens next must be in line with the Prophecies as foretold by you and/or the Harbinger, but otherwise anything you say becomes true.</p>
    <p>You cannot use this Move while it is marked.</p>
    <p><b>When you earn Fellowship,</b> remove your mark from this Move.</p>
    <h3>I CAN DO THIS</h3>
    <p><b>When you act on your own,</b> you can use your memories of what you&#39;re fighting for to inspire you. Your bonds have the Vigor tag, and you can use them by erasing them.</p>

Hexes are narrative - tell us what they lose and what they gain, such as losing arms to gain wings, losing claws to gain suction cups, or losing speech to gain gills.</p><p>Your hexes always end at dawn&#39;s first light. Hexes never work on a <b>Threat to the World. If you try to hex another player, </b>they may attempt to <i>Overcome </i>your hex after you tell them what it is. Your hexes can never be directly lethal, such as taking away the ability to breathe.</p><p>Otherwise, your hexes always work every time.</p>
